# Articles, Code and Events of note

This is my collection of article references, code and events noticed around
the web. The types of things that wind up in my inconsistent output on Google
plus and twitter.

Our friends in the GSA, an agency of the United States federal government, have
put together something interesting for publishing static sites in a consistent,
unified and importantly an accessible (509 compliant) manner. The system is
called [the federalist platform](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/09/15/federalist-platform-launch/)
and you can get the code on Github at [github.com/18F/federalist](https://github.com/18F/federalist).
The system builds on other open source projects like [Prose](https://github.com/prose/prose),
[NodeJS](http://nodejs.org) and some [Ruby](http://ruby-lang.org). It appears
to follow the [twelve factor app](http://12factor.net/) approach for cloud
integration.  Looking forward to playing with the code that our tax dollars
produced.

F18 has a nice article an progressive enhancement summarizing with an [M&M]((https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/08/26/aaron-gustafson-beyond-responsive-design/)
analogy. Discusses, why, and how to approach progressive enhancement. Good
highlight on addressing the world most of us experience on the web who see it
without the lens of iPhones, iPads and nice Macbooks. Includes a nice Q&A with
Aaron Gustafson.
