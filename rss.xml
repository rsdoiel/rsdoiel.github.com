I am sure&#xD;&#xA;our volunteers will find and correct errors I didn&#39;t catch,&#xD;&#xA;and that version 0.2 - 1.0 will have significant improvements,&#xD;&#xA;as well as at least one more version in Latin.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Version 1.0 may contain a dozen different versions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Text of Magna Carta&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;JOHN, by the grace of God King of England, Lord of Ireland, Duke of&#xD;&#xA;Normandy and Aquitaine, and Count of Anjou, to his archbishops,&#xD;&#xA;bishops, abbots, earls, barons, justices, foresters, sheriffs,&#xD;&#xA;stewards, servants, and to all his officials and loyal subjects,&#xD;&#xA;Greeting.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;KNOW THAT BEFORE GOD, for the health of our soul and those of our&#xD;&#xA;ancestors and heirs, to the honour of God, the exaltation of the holy&#xD;&#xA;Church, and the better ordering of our kingdom, at the advice of our&#xD;&#xA;reverend fathers Stephen, archbishop of Canterbury, primate of all&#xD;&#xA;England, and cardinal of the holy Roman Church, Henry archbishop of&#xD;&#xA;Dublin, William bishop of London, Peter bishop of Winchester, Jocelin&#xD;&#xA;bishop of Bath and Glastonbury, Hugh bishop of Lincoln, Walter Bishop&#xD;&#xA;of Worcester, William bishop of Coventry, Benedict bishop of&#xD;&#xA;Rochester, Master Pandulf subdeacon and member of the papal household,&#xD;&#xA;Brother Aymeric master of the knighthood of the Temple in England,&#xD;&#xA;William Marshal earl of Pembroke, William earl of Salisbury, William&#xD;&#xA;earl of Warren, William earl of Arundel, Alan de Galloway constable of&#xD;&#xA;Scotland, Warin Fitz Gerald, Peter Fitz Herbert, Hubert de Burgh&#xD;&#xA;seneschal of Poitou, Hugh de Neville, Matthew Fitz Herbert, Thomas&#xD;&#xA;Basset, Alan Basset, Philip Daubeny, Robert de Roppeley, John Marshal,&#xD;&#xA;John Fitz Hugh, and other loyal subjects:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(1) FIRST, THAT WE HAVE GRANTED TO GOD, and by this present charter&#xD;&#xA;have confirmed for us and our heirs in perpetuity, that the English&#xD;&#xA;Church shall be free, and shall have its rights undiminished, and its&#xD;&#xA;liberties unimpaired. That we wish this so to be observed, appears&#xD;&#xA;from the fact that of our own free will, before the outbreak of the&#xD;&#xA;present dispute between us and our barons, we granted and confirmed by&#xD;&#xA;charter the freedom of the Church&#39;s elections - a right reckoned to be&#xD;&#xA;of the greatest necessity and importance to it - and caused this to be&#xD;&#xA;confirmed by Pope Innocent III. This freedom we shall observe ourselves,&#xD;&#xA;and desire to be observed in good faith by our heirs in perpetuity.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;TO ALL FREE MEN OF OUR KINGDOM we have also granted, for us and our&#xD;&#xA;heirs for ever, all the liberties written out below, to have and to&#xD;&#xA;keep for them and their heirs, of us and our heirs:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(2) If any earl, baron, or other person that holds lands directly of&#xD;&#xA;the Crown, for military service, shall die, and at his death his heir&#xD;&#xA;shall be of full age and owe a `relief&#39;, the heir shall have his&#xD;&#xA;inheritance on payment of the ancient scale of `relief&#39;. That is to&#xD;&#xA;say, the heir or heirs of an earl shall pay 100 for the entire earl&#39;s&#xD;&#xA;barony, the heir or heirs of a knight 100s. at most for the entire&#xD;&#xA;knight&#39;s `fee&#39;, and any man that owes less shall pay less, in&#xD;&#xA;accordance with the ancient usage of `fees&#39;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(3) But if the heir of such a person is under age and a ward, when he&#xD;&#xA;comes of age he shall have his inheritance without `relief&#39; or fine.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(4) The guardian of the land of an heir who is under age shall take&#xD;&#xA;from it only reasonable revenues, customary dues, and feudal services.&#xD;&#xA;He shall do this without destruction or damage to men or property. If&#xD;&#xA;we have given the guardianship of the land to a sheriff, or to any&#xD;&#xA;person answerable to us for the revenues, and he commits destruction&#xD;&#xA;or damage, we will exact compensation from him, and the land shall be&#xD;&#xA;entrusted to two worthy and prudent men of the same `fee&#39;, who shall&#xD;&#xA;be answerable to us for the revenues, or to the person to whom we have&#xD;&#xA;assigned them. If we have given or sold to anyone the guardianship of&#xD;&#xA;such land, and he causes destruction or damage, he shall lose the&#xD;&#xA;guardianship of it, and it shall be handed over to two worthy and&#xD;&#xA;prudent men of the same `fee&#39;, who shall be similarly answerable to&#xD;&#xA;us.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(5) For so long as a guardian has guardianship of such land, he shall&#xD;&#xA;maintain the houses, parks, fish preserves, ponds, mills, and&#xD;&#xA;everything else pertaining to it, from the revenues of the land&#xD;&#xA;itself. When the heir comes of age, he shall restore the whole land to&#xD;&#xA;him, stocked with plough teams and such implements of husbandry as the&#xD;&#xA;season demands and the revenues from the land can reasonably bear.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(6) Heirs may be given in marriage, but not to someone of lower social&#xD;&#xA;standing. Before a marriage takes place, it shall be&#39; made known to&#xD;&#xA;the heir&#39;s next-of-kin.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(7) At her husband&#39;s death, a widow may have her marriage portion and&#xD;&#xA;inheritance at once and without trouble. She shall pay nothing for her&#xD;&#xA;dower, marriage portion, or any inheritance that she and her husband&#xD;&#xA;held jointly on the day of his death. She may remain in her husband&#39;s&#xD;&#xA;house for forty days after his death, and within this period her dower&#xD;&#xA;shall be assigned to her.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(8) No widow shall be compelled to marry, so long as she wishes to&#xD;&#xA;remain without a husband. But she must give security that she will not&#xD;&#xA;marry without royal consent, if she holds her lands of the Crown, or&#xD;&#xA;without the consent of whatever other lord she may hold them of.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(9) Neither we nor our officials will seize any land or rent in&#xD;&#xA;payment of a debt, so long as the debtor has movable goods sufficient&#xD;&#xA;to discharge the debt. A debtor&#39;s sureties shall not be distrained&#xD;&#xA;upon so long as the debtor himself can discharge his debt. If, for&#xD;&#xA;lack of means, the debtor is unable to discharge his debt, his&#xD;&#xA;sureties shall be answerable for it. If they so desire, they may have&#xD;&#xA;the debtor&#39;s lands and rents until they have received satisfaction for&#xD;&#xA;the debt that they paid for him, unless the debtor can show that he&#xD;&#xA;has settled his obligations to them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(10) If anyone who has borrowed a sum of money from Jews dies before&#xD;&#xA;the debt has been repaid, his heir shall pay no interest on the debt&#xD;&#xA;for so long as he remains under age, irrespective of whom he holds his&#xD;&#xA;lands. If such a debt falls into the hands of the Crown, it will take&#xD;&#xA;nothing except the principal sum specified in the bond.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(11) If a man dies owing money to Jews, his wife may have her dower&#xD;&#xA;and pay nothing towards the debt from it. If he leaves children that&#xD;&#xA;are under age, their needs may also be provided for on a scale&#xD;&#xA;appropriate to the size of his holding of lands. The debt is to be&#xD;&#xA;paid out of the residue, reserving the service due to his feudal lords.&#xD;&#xA;Debts owed to persons other than Jews are to be dealt with similarly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(12) No `scutage&#39; or `aid&#39; may be levied in our kingdom without its&#xD;&#xA;general consent, unless it is for the ransom of our person, to make&#xD;&#xA;our eldest son a knight, and (once) to marry our eldest daughter. For&#xD;&#xA;these purposes only a reasonable `aid&#39; may be levied. `Aids&#39; from the&#xD;&#xA;city of London are to be treated similarly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(13) The city of London shall enjoy all its ancient liberties and&#xD;&#xA;free customs, both by land and by water. We also will and grant that&#xD;&#xA;all other cities, boroughs, towns, and ports shall enjoy all their&#xD;&#xA;liberties and free customs.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; (14) To obtain the general consent of the realm for the assessment&#xD;&#xA;of an `aid&#39; - except in the three cases specified above - or a&#xD;&#xA;`scutage&#39;, we will cause the archbishops, bishops, abbots, earls, and&#xD;&#xA;greater barons to be summoned individually by letter. To those who&#xD;&#xA;hold lands directly of us we will cause a general summons to be&#xD;&#xA;issued, through the sheriffs and other officials, to come together on&#xD;&#xA;a fixed day (of which at least forty days notice shall be given) and&#xD;&#xA;at a fixed place. In all letters of summons, the cause of the summons&#xD;&#xA;will be stated. When a summons has been issued, the business appointed&#xD;&#xA;for the day shall go forward in accordance with the resolution of&#xD;&#xA;those present, even if not all those who were summoned have appeared.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(15) In future we will allow no one to levy an `aid&#39; from his free&#xD;&#xA;men, except to ransom his person, to make his eldest son a knight, and&#xD;&#xA;(once) to marry his eldest daughter. For these purposes only a&#xD;&#xA;reasonable `aid&#39; may be levied.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(16) No man shall be forced to perform more service for a knight&#39;s&#xD;&#xA;`fee&#39;, or other free holding of land, than is due from it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(17) Ordinary lawsuits shall not follow the royal court around, but&#xD;&#xA;shall be held in a fixed place.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(18) Inquests of novel disseisin, mort d&#39;ancestor, and darrein&#xD;&#xA;presentment shall be taken only in their proper county court. We&#xD;&#xA;ourselves, or in our absence abroad our chief justice, will send two&#xD;&#xA;justices to each county four times a year, and these justices, with&#xD;&#xA;four knights of the county elected by the county itself, shall hold&#xD;&#xA;the assizes in the county court, on the day and in the place where the&#xD;&#xA;court meets.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(19) If any assizes cannot be taken on the day of the county court, as&#xD;&#xA;many knights and freeholders shall afterwards remain behind, of those&#xD;&#xA;who have attended the court, as will suffice for the administration of&#xD;&#xA;justice, having regard to the volume of business to be done.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(20) For a trivial offence, a free man shall be fined only in&#xD;&#xA;proportion to the degree of his offence, and for a serious offence&#xD;&#xA;correspondingly, but not so heavily as to deprive him of his&#xD;&#xA;livelihood. In the same way, a merchant shall be spared his&#xD;&#xA;merchandise, and a husbandman the implements of his husbandry, if they&#xD;&#xA;fall upon the mercy of a royal court. None of these fines shall be&#xD;&#xA;imposed except by the assessment on oath of reputable men of the&#xD;&#xA;neighbourhood.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(21) Earls and barons shall be fined only by their equals, and in&#xD;&#xA;proportion to the gravity of their offence.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(22) A fine imposed upon the lay property of a clerk in holy orders&#xD;&#xA;shall be assessed upon the same principles, without reference to the&#xD;&#xA;value of his ecclesiastical benefice.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(23) No town or person shall be forced to build bridges over rivers&#xD;&#xA;except those with an ancient obligation to do so.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(24) No sheriff, constable, coroners, or other royal officials are to&#xD;&#xA;hold lawsuits that should be held by the royal justices.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(25) Every county, hundred, wapentake, and tithing shall remain at&#xD;&#xA;its ancient rent, without increase, except the royal demesne manors.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(26) If at the death of a man who holds a lay `fee&#39; of the Crown, a&#xD;&#xA;sheriff or royal official produces royal letters patent of summons for&#xD;&#xA;a debt due to the Crown, it shall be lawful for them to seize and list&#xD;&#xA;movable goods found in the lay `fee&#39; of the dead man to the value of&#xD;&#xA;the debt, as assessed by worthy men. Nothing shall be removed until&#xD;&#xA;the whole debt is paid, when the residue shall be given over to the&#xD;&#xA;executors to carry out the dead man&#39;s will. If no debt is due to the&#xD;&#xA;Crown, all the movable goods shall be regarded as the property of the&#xD;&#xA;dead man, except the reasonable shares of his wife and children.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(27) If a free man dies intestate, his movable goods are to be&#xD;&#xA;distributed by his next-of-kin and friends, under the supervision of&#xD;&#xA;the Church. The rights of his debtors are to be preserved.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(28) No constable or other royal official shall take corn or other&#xD;&#xA;movable goods from any man without immediate payment, unless the&#xD;&#xA;seller voluntarily offers postponement of this.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(29) No constable may compel a knight to pay money for castle-guard if&#xD;&#xA;the knight is willing to undertake the guard in person, or with&#xD;&#xA;reasonable excuse to supply some other fit man to do it. A knight&#xD;&#xA;taken or sent on military service shall be excused from castle-guard&#xD;&#xA;for the period of this service.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(30) No sheriff, royal official, or other person shall take horses or&#xD;&#xA;carts for transport from any free man, without his consent.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(31) Neither we nor any royal official will take wood for our castle,&#xD;&#xA;or for any other purpose, without the consent of the owner.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(32) We will not keep the lands of people convicted of felony in our&#xD;&#xA;hand for longer than a year and a day, after which they shall be&#xD;&#xA;returned to the lords of the `fees&#39; concerned.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(33) All fish-weirs shall be removed from the Thames, the Medway, and&#xD;&#xA;throughout the whole of England, except on the sea coast.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(34) The writ called precipe shall not in future be issued to anyone&#xD;&#xA;in respect of any holding of land, if a free man could thereby be&#xD;&#xA;deprived of the right of trial in his own lord&#39;s court.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(35) There shall be standard measures of wine, ale, and corn (the&#xD;&#xA;London quarter), throughout the kingdom. There shall also be a&#xD;&#xA;standard width of dyed cloth, russett, and haberject, namely two ells&#xD;&#xA;within the selvedges. Weights are to be standardised similarly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(36) In future nothing shall be paid or accepted for the issue of a&#xD;&#xA;writ of inquisition of life or limbs. It shall be given gratis, and&#xD;&#xA;not refused.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(37) If a man holds land of the Crown by `fee-farm&#39;, `socage&#39;, or&#xD;&#xA;`burgage&#39;, and also holds land of someone else for knight&#39;s service,&#xD;&#xA;we will not have guardianship of his heir, nor of the land that&#xD;&#xA;belongs to the other person&#39;s `fee&#39;, by virtue of the `fee-farm&#39;,&#xD;&#xA;`socage&#39;, or `burgage&#39;, unless the `fee-farm&#39; owes knight&#39;s service.&#xD;&#xA;We will not have the guardianship of a man&#39;s heir, or of land that he&#xD;&#xA;holds of someone else, by reason of any small property that he may&#xD;&#xA;hold of the Crown for a service of knives, arrows, or the like.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(38) In future no official shall place a man on trial upon his own&#xD;&#xA;unsupported statement, without producing credible witnesses to the&#xD;&#xA;truth of it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(39) No free man shall be seized or imprisoned, or stripped of his&#xD;&#xA;rights or possessions, or outlawed or exiled, or deprived of his&#xD;&#xA;standing in any other way, nor will we proceed with force against him,&#xD;&#xA;or send others to do so, except by the lawful judgement of his equals&#xD;&#xA;or by the law of the land.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(40) To no one will we sell, to no one deny or delay right or justice.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(41) All merchants may enter or leave England unharmed and without&#xD;&#xA;fear, and may stay or travel within it, by land or water, for purposes&#xD;&#xA;of trade, free from all illegal exactions, in accordance with ancient&#xD;&#xA;and lawful customs. This, however, does not apply in time of war to&#xD;&#xA;merchants from a country that is at war with us. Any such merchants&#xD;&#xA;found in our country at the outbreak of war shall be detained without&#xD;&#xA;injury to their persons or property, until we or our chief justice&#xD;&#xA;have discovered how our own merchants are being treated in the country&#xD;&#xA;at war with us. If our own merchants are safe they shall be safe too.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(42) In future it shall be lawful for any man to leave and return to&#xD;&#xA;our kingdom unharmed and without fear, by land or water, preserving&#xD;&#xA;his allegiance to us, except in time of war, for some short period,&#xD;&#xA;for the common benefit of the realm. People that have been imprisoned&#xD;&#xA;or outlawed in accordance with the law of the land, people from a&#xD;&#xA;country that is at war with us, and merchants - who shall be dealt&#xD;&#xA;with as stated above - are excepted from this provision.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(43) If a man holds lands of any `escheat&#39; such as the `honour&#39; of&#xD;&#xA;Wallingford, Nottingham, Boulogne, Lancaster, or of other `escheats&#39;&#xD;&#xA;in our hand that are baronies, at his death his heir shall give us&#xD;&#xA;only the `relief&#39; and service that he would have made to the baron,&#xD;&#xA;had the barony been in the baron&#39;s hand. We will hold the `escheat&#39; in&#xD;&#xA;the same manner as the baron held it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(44) People who live outside the forest need not in future appear&#xD;&#xA;before the royal justices of the forest in answer to general&#xD;&#xA;summonses, unless they are actually involved in proceedings or are&#xD;&#xA;sureties for someone who has been seized for a forest offence.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(45) We will appoint as justices, constables, sheriffs, or other&#xD;&#xA;officials, only men that know the law of the realm and are minded to&#xD;&#xA;keep it well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(46) All barons who have founded abbeys, and have charters of English&#xD;&#xA;kings or ancient tenure as evidence of this, may have guardianship of&#xD;&#xA;them when there is no abbot, as is their due.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(47) All forests that have been created in our reign shall at once be&#xD;&#xA;disafforested. River-banks that have been enclosed in our reign shall&#xD;&#xA;be treated similarly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(48) All evil customs relating to forests and warrens, foresters,&#xD;&#xA;warreners, sheriffs and their servants, or river-banks and their&#xD;&#xA;wardens, are at once to be investigated in every county by twelve&#xD;&#xA;sworn knights of the county, and within forty days of their enquiry&#xD;&#xA;the evil customs are to be abolished completely and irrevocably. But&#xD;&#xA;we, or our chief justice if we are not in England, are first to be&#xD;&#xA;informed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(49) We will at once return all hostages and charters delivered up&#xD;&#xA;to us by Englishmen as security for peace or for loyal service.&#xD;&#xA;***here were some strange characters, not completely removed&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(50) We will remove completely from their offices the kinsmen of&#xD;&#xA;Gerard de Ath, Peter, Guy, and Andrew de Chanceaux, Guy de Cigogne, and in&#xD;&#xA;future they shall hold no offices in England. The&#xD;&#xA;people in question are Engelard de Cigogn, Geoffrey de Martigny and his&#xD;&#xA;brothers, Philip Marc and his brothers, with Geoffrey his nephew,&#xD;&#xA;and all their followers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* As soon as peace is restored, we will remove from the kingdom all&#xD;&#xA;the foreign knights, bowmen, their attendants, and the mercenaries&#xD;&#xA;that have come to it, to its harm, with horses and arms.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* To any man whom we have deprived or dispossessed of lands,&#xD;&#xA;castles, liberties, or rights, without the lawful judgement of his&#xD;&#xA;equals, we will at once restore these. In cases of dispute the&#xD;&#xA;matter shall be resolved by the judgement of the twenty-five&#xD;&#xA;barons referred to below in the clause for securing the peace. In&#xD;&#xA;cases, however, where a man was deprived or dispossessed of&#xD;&#xA;something without the lawful judgement of his equals by our father&#xD;&#xA;King Henry or our brother King Richard, and it remains in our&#xD;&#xA;hands or is held by others under our warranty, we shall have&#xD;&#xA;respite for the period commonly allowed to Crusaders, unless a&#xD;&#xA;lawsuit had been begun, or an enquiry had been made at our order,&#xD;&#xA;before we took the Cross as a Crusader. On our return from the&#xD;&#xA;Crusade, or if we abandon it, we will at once render justice in&#xD;&#xA;full.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* We shall have similar respite in rendering justice in connexion&#xD;&#xA;with forests that are to be disafforested, or to remain forests,&#xD;&#xA;when these were first aforested by our father Henry or our brother&#xD;&#xA;Richard; with the guardianship of lands in another persons fee,&#xD;&#xA;when we have hitherto had this by virtue of a fee held of us for&#xD;&#xA;knights service by a third party; and with abbeys founded in&#xD;&#xA;another persons fee, in which the lord of the fee claims to own a&#xD;&#xA;right. On our return from the Crusade, or if we abandon it, we&#xD;&#xA;will at once do full justice to complaints about these matters.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* No one shall be arrested or imprisoned on the appeal of a woman&#xD;&#xA;for the death of any person except her husband.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* All fines that have been given to us unjustly and against the law&#xD;&#xA;of the land, and all fines that we have exacted unjustly, shall be&#xD;&#xA;entirely remitted or the matter decided by a majority judgement of&#xD;&#xA;the twenty-five barons referred to below in the clause for&#xD;&#xA;securing the peace together with Stephen, archbishop of&#xD;&#xA;Canterbury, if he can be present, and such others as he wishes to&#xD;&#xA;bring with him. If the archbishop cannot be present, proceedings&#xD;&#xA;shall continue without him, provided that if any of the&#xD;&#xA;twenty-five barons has been involved in a similar suit himself,&#xD;&#xA;his judgement shall be set aside, and someone else chosen and&#xD;&#xA;sworn in his place, as a substitute for the single occasion, by&#xD;&#xA;the rest of the twenty-five.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* If we have deprived or dispossessed any Welshmen of lands,&#xD;&#xA;liberties, or anything else in England or in Wales, without the&#xD;&#xA;lawful judgement of their equals, these are at once to be returned&#xD;&#xA;to them. A dispute on this point shall be determined in the&#xD;&#xA;Marches by the judgement of equals. English law shall apply to&#xD;&#xA;holdings of land in England, Welsh law to those in Wales, and the&#xD;&#xA;law of the Marches to those in the Marches. The Welsh shall treat&#xD;&#xA;us and ours in the same way.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* In cases where a Welshman was deprived or dispossessed of&#xD;&#xA;anything, without the lawful judgement of his equals, by our&#xD;&#xA;father King Henry or our brother King Richard, and it remains in&#xD;&#xA;our hands or is held by others under our warranty, we shall have&#xD;&#xA;respite for the period commonly allowed to Crusaders, unless a&#xD;&#xA;lawsuit had been begun, or an enquiry had been made at our order,&#xD;&#xA;before we took the Cross as a Crusader. But on our return from the&#xD;&#xA;Crusade, or if we abandon it, we will at once do full justice&#xD;&#xA;according to the laws of Wales and the said regions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* We will at once return the son of Llywelyn, all Welsh hostages,&#xD;&#xA;and the charters delivered to us as security for the peace.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* With regard to the return of the sisters and hostages of&#xD;&#xA;Alexander, king of Scotland, his liberties and his rights, we will&#xD;&#xA;treat him in the same way as our other barons of England, unless&#xD;&#xA;it appears from the charters that we hold from his father William,&#xD;&#xA;formerly king of Scotland, that he should be treated otherwise.&#xD;&#xA;This matter shall be resolved by the judgement of his equals in&#xD;&#xA;our court.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* All these customs and liberties that we have granted shall be&#xD;&#xA;observed in our kingdom in so far as concerns our own relations&#xD;&#xA;with our subjects. Let all men of our kingdom, whether clergy or&#xD;&#xA;laymen, observe them similarly in their relations with their own&#xD;&#xA;men.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;***Strange characters may have ended here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;SINCE WE HAVE GRANTED ALL THESE THINGS for God, for the better&#xD;&#xA;ordering of our kingdom, and to allay the discord that has arisen&#xD;&#xA;between us and our barons, and since we desire that they shall be&#xD;&#xA;enjoyed in their entirety, with lasting strength, for ever, we give&#xD;&#xA;and grant to the barons the following security:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* The barons shall elect twenty-five of their number to keep, and&#xD;&#xA;cause to be observed with all their might, the peace and liberties&#xD;&#xA;granted and confirmed to them by this charter.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* If we, our chief justice, our officials, or any of our servants&#xD;&#xA;offend in any respect against any man, or transgress any of the&#xD;&#xA;articles of the peace or of this security, and the offence is made&#xD;&#xA;known to four of the said twenty-five barons, they shall come to&#xD;&#xA;us - or in our absence from the kingdom to the chief justice - to&#xD;&#xA;declare it and claim immediate redress. If we, or in our absence&#xD;&#xA;abroad the chief justice, make no redress within forty days,&#xD;&#xA;reckoning from the day on which the offence was declared to us or&#xD;&#xA;to him, the four barons shall refer the matter to the rest of the&#xD;&#xA;twenty-five barons, who may distrain upon and assail us in every&#xD;&#xA;way possible, with the support of the whole community of the land,&#xD;&#xA;by seizing our castles, lands, possessions, or anything else&#xD;&#xA;saving only our own person and those of the queen and our&#xD;&#xA;children, until they have secured such redress as they have&#xD;&#xA;determined upon. Having secured the redress, they may then resume&#xD;&#xA;their normal obedience to us.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Any man who so desires may take an oath to obey the commands of&#xD;&#xA;the twenty-five barons for the achievement of these ends, and to&#xD;&#xA;join with them in assailing us to the utmost of his power. We give&#xD;&#xA;public and free permission to take this oath to any man who so&#xD;&#xA;desires, and at no time will we prohibit any man from taking it.&#xD;&#xA;Indeed, we will compel any of our subjects who are unwilling to&#xD;&#xA;take it to swear it at our command.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* If one of the twenty-five barons dies or leaves the country, or is&#xD;&#xA;prevented in any other way from discharging his duties, the rest&#xD;&#xA;of them shall choose another baron in his place, at their&#xD;&#xA;discretion, who shall be duly sworn in as they were.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* In the event of disagreement among the twenty-five barons on any&#xD;&#xA;matter referred to them for decision, the verdict of the majority&#xD;&#xA;present shall have the same validity as a unanimous verdict of the&#xD;&#xA;whole twenty-five, whether these were all present or some of those&#xD;&#xA;summoned were unwilling or unable to appear.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* The twenty-five barons shall swear to obey all the above articles&#xD;&#xA;faithfully, and shall cause them to be obeyed by others to the&#xD;&#xA;best of their power.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* We will not seek to procure from anyone, either by our own efforts&#xD;&#xA;or those of a third party, anything by which any part of these&#xD;&#xA;concessions or liberties might be revoked or diminished. Should&#xD;&#xA;such a thing be procured, it shall be null and void and we will at&#xD;&#xA;no time make use of it, either ourselves or through a third party.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We have remitted and pardoned fully to all men any ill-will, hurt, or&#xD;&#xA;grudges that have arisen between us and our subjects, whether clergy&#xD;&#xA;or laymen, since the beginning of the dispute.&#xD;&#xA;We have in addition remitted fully, and for our own part have also&#xD;&#xA;pardoned, to all clergy and laymen any offences committed as a result&#xD;&#xA;of the said dispute between Easter 1215 AD and the restoration of&#xD;&#xA;peace.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In addition we have caused letters patent to be made for the barons,&#xD;&#xA;bearing witness to this security and to the concessions set out above,&#xD;&#xA;over the seals of Stephen archbishop of Canterbury, Henry archbishop&#xD;&#xA;of Dublin, the other bishops named above, and Master Pandulf.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;IT IS ACCORDINGLY OUR WISH AND COMMAND that the English Church shall&#xD;&#xA;be free, and that men in our kingdom shall have and keep all these&#xD;&#xA;liberties, rights, and concessions, well and peaceably in their&#xD;&#xA;fulness and entirety for them and their heirs, of us and our heirs, in&#xD;&#xA;all things and all places for ever.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Both we and the barons have sworn that all this shall be observed in&#xD;&#xA;good faith and without deceit. Witness the above mentioned people and&#xD;&#xA;many others.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Given by our hand in the meadow that is called Runnymede, between&#xD;&#xA;Windsor and Staines, on the fifteenth day of June in the seventeenth&#xD;&#xA;year of our reign.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;***&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[There were many missing spaces in this one, not sure I got them all]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Magna Carta 1215&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;John, by the grace of God, king of England, lord of Ireland, duke of&#xD;&#xA;Normandy and Aquitaine, and count of Anjou, to the archbishops,&#xD;&#xA;bishops, abbots, earls, barons, justiciars, foresters, sheriffs,&#xD;&#xA;stewards, servants, and to all his bailiffs and liege subjects,&#xD;&#xA;greeting. Know that, having regard to God and for the salvation of our&#xD;&#xA;soul, and those of all our ancestors and heirs, and unto the honor of&#xD;&#xA;God and the advancement of holy church, and for the reform of&#xD;&#xA;our realm, by advice of our venerable fathers, Stephen archbishop of&#xD;&#xA;Canterbury, primate of all England and cardinal of the holy Roman&#xD;&#xA;Church, Henry archbishop of Dublin, William of London, Peter of&#xD;&#xA;Winchester, Jocelyn of Bath and Glastonbury, Hugh of Lincoln, Walter of&#xD;&#xA;Worcester, William of Coventry, Benedict of Rochester, bishops; of&#xD;&#xA;master Pandulf, subdeacon and member of the household of our lord the&#xD;&#xA;Pope, of brother Aymeric (master of the Knights of the Temple in&#xD;&#xA;England), and of the illustrious men William Marshall earl of Pembroke,&#xD;&#xA;William earl of Salisbury, William earl of Warenne, William earl&#xD;&#xA;of Arundel, Alan of Galloway (constable of Scotland), Waren Fitz&#xD;&#xA;Gerald, Peter Fits Herbert, Hubert de Burgh (seneschal of Poitou), Hugh&#xD;&#xA;de Neville, Matthew Fitz Herbert, Thomas Basset, Alan Basset, Philip&#xD;&#xA;d&#39;Aubigny, Robert of Roppesley, John Marshall, John Fitz Hugh, and&#xD;&#xA;others, our liegemen.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. In the first place we have granted to God, and by this our present&#xD;&#xA;charter confirmed for us and our heirs for ever that the English church&#xD;&#xA;shall be free, and shall have her rights entire, and her liberties&#xD;&#xA;inviolate; and we will that it be thus observed; which is apparent from&#xD;&#xA;this that the freedom of elections, which is reckoned most important&#xD;&#xA;and very essential to the English church, we, of our pure and&#xD;&#xA;unconstrained will, did grant, and did by our charter confirm and did&#xD;&#xA;obtain the ratification of the same from our lord, Pope Innocent&#xD;&#xA;III., before the quarrel arose between us and our barons: and this we&#xD;&#xA;will observe, and our will is that it be observed in good faith by our&#xD;&#xA;heirs for ever. We have also granted to all freemen of our kingdom, for&#xD;&#xA;us and our heirs for ever, all the underwritten liberties, to be had&#xD;&#xA;and held by them and their heirs, of us and our heirs for ever.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. If any of our earls or barons, or others holding of us in chief by&#xD;&#xA;military service shall have died, and at the time of his death his heir&#xD;&#xA;shall be of full age and owe &#34;relief&#34; he shall have his inheritance on&#xD;&#xA;payment of the ancient relief, namely the heir or heirs of an earl, 100&#xD;&#xA;pounds for a whole earl&#39;s barony; the heir or heirs of a baron, 100&#xD;&#xA;pounds for a whole barony; the heir or heirs of a knight, 100 shillings&#xD;&#xA;at most for a whole knight&#39;s fee; and whoever owes less let him give&#xD;&#xA;less, according to the ancient custom officers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. If, however, the heir of any of the aforesaid has been under age&#xD;&#xA;and in wardship, let him have his inheritance without relief and&#xD;&#xA;without fine when he comes of age.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;4. The guardian of the land of an heir who is thus under age, shall&#xD;&#xA;take from the land of the heir nothing but reasonably produce,&#xD;&#xA;reasonable customs, and reasonable services, and that without&#xD;&#xA;destruction or waste of men or goods; and if we have committed the&#xD;&#xA;wardship of the lands of any such minor to the sheriff, or to any other&#xD;&#xA;who is responsible to us for its issues, and he has made destruction or&#xD;&#xA;waste of what he holds in wardship, we will take of him amends, and the&#xD;&#xA;land shall be committed to two lawful and discreet men of that fee, who&#xD;&#xA;shall be responsible for the issues to us or to him to whom we&#xD;&#xA;shall assign them; and if we have given or sold the wardship of any&#xD;&#xA;such land to anyone and he has there in made destruction or waste, he&#xD;&#xA;shall lose that wardship, and it shall be transferred to two lawful and&#xD;&#xA;discreet men of that fief, who shall be responsible to us in like&#xD;&#xA;manner as aforesaid.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;5. The guardian, moreover, so long as he has the wardship of the land,&#xD;&#xA;shall keep up the houses, parks, fishponds, stanks, mills, and other&#xD;&#xA;things pertaining to the land, out of the issues of the same land; and&#xD;&#xA;he shall restore to the heir, when he has come to full age, all his&#xD;&#xA;land, stocked with ploughs and &#34;waynage,&#34; according as the season of&#xD;&#xA;husbandry shall require, and the issues of the land can reasonably bear.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;6. Heirs shall be married without disparagement, yet so that before the&#xD;&#xA;marriage takes place the nearest in blood to that heir shall have notice.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;7. A widow, after the death of her husband, shall forthwith and&#xD;&#xA;without difficulty have her marriage portion and inheritance; nor shall&#xD;&#xA;she give anything for her dower, or for her marriage portion, or for&#xD;&#xA;the inheritance which her husband and she held on the day of the death&#xD;&#xA;of that husband; and she may remain in the house of her husband for&#xD;&#xA;fourty days after his death, within which time her dower shall be&#xD;&#xA;assigned to her.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;8. No widow shall be compelled to marry, so long as she prefers to&#xD;&#xA;live without a husband; provided always that she gives security not to&#xD;&#xA;marry without our consent, if she holds of us, or without the consent&#xD;&#xA;of the lord of whom she holds, if she holds of another.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;9. Neither we nor our bailiffs shall seize any land or rent for any&#xD;&#xA;debt, so long as the chattels of the debtor are sufficient to repay the&#xD;&#xA;debt; nor shall the sureties of the debtor be distrained so long as the&#xD;&#xA;principal debtor is able to satisfy the debt; and if the principal&#xD;&#xA;debtor shall fail to pay the debt, having nothing wherewith to pay it,&#xD;&#xA;then the sureties shall answer for the debt; and let them have the&#xD;&#xA;lands and rents of the debtor, if they desire them, until they are&#xD;&#xA;indemnified for the debt which they have paid for him, unless the&#xD;&#xA;principal debtor can show proof that he is discharged thereof as&#xD;&#xA;against the said sureties.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;10. If one who has borrowed from the Jews any sum, great or small, die&#xD;&#xA;before that loan can be repaid, the debt shall not bear interest while&#xD;&#xA;the heir is under age, of whomsoever he may hold; and if the debt fall&#xD;&#xA;into our hands, we will not take anything except the principal sum&#xD;&#xA;contained in the bond.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;11. And if any one die indebted to the Jews, his wife shall have her&#xD;&#xA;dower and pay nothing of that debt; and if any children of the deceased&#xD;&#xA;are left underage, necessaries shall be provided for them in keeping&#xD;&#xA;with the holding of the deceased; and out of the residue the debt shall&#xD;&#xA;be paid, reserving, however, service due to feudal lords; in like&#xD;&#xA;manner let it be done touching debts due to others than Jews.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;12. No scutage nor aid shall be imposed on our kingdom, unless by&#xD;&#xA;common counsel of our kingdom, except for ransoming our person, for&#xD;&#xA;making our eldest son a knight, and for once marrying our eldest&#xD;&#xA;daughter; and for these there shall not be levied more than a&#xD;&#xA;reasonable aid. In like manner it shall be done concerning aids from&#xD;&#xA;the city of London.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;13. And the city of London shall have all its ancient liberties and&#xD;&#xA;free customs, as well by land as by water; furthermore, we decree and&#xD;&#xA;grant that all other cities, boroughs, towns, and ports shall have all&#xD;&#xA;their liberties and free customs.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;14. And for obtaining the common counsel of the kingdom anent the&#xD;&#xA;assessing of an aid (except in the three cases aforesaid) or of a&#xD;&#xA;scutage, we will cause to be summoned the archbishops, bishops, abbots,&#xD;&#xA;earls, and greater barons, severally by our letters; and we will&#xD;&#xA;moreover cause to be summoned generally, through our sheriffs and&#xD;&#xA;bailiffs, all others who hold of us in chief, for a fixed date, namely,&#xD;&#xA;after the expiry of at least forty days, and at a fixed place; and in&#xD;&#xA;all letters of such summons we will specify the reason of the summons.&#xD;&#xA;And when the summons has thus been made, the business shall proceed on&#xD;&#xA;the day appointed, according to the counsel of such as are present,&#xD;&#xA;although not all who were summoned have come.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;15. We will not for the future grant to any one license to take an aid&#xD;&#xA;from his own free tenants, except to ransom his body, to make his&#xD;&#xA;eldest son a knight, and once to marry his eldest daughter; and on&#xD;&#xA;each of these occasions there shall be levied only a reasonable aid.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;16. No one shall be distrained for performance of greater service for&#xD;&#xA;a knight&#39;s fee, or for any other free tenement, than is due therefrom.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;17. Common pleas shall not follow our court, but shall be held in some&#xD;&#xA;fixed place.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;18. Inquests of novel disseisin, of mort d&#39;ancester, and of darrein&#xD;&#xA;presentment, shall not be held elsewhere than in their own county&#xD;&#xA;courts and that in manner following,--We, or, if we should be out of&#xD;&#xA;the realm, our chief justiciar, will send two justiciars through&#xD;&#xA;every county four times a year, who shall, along with four knights of&#xD;&#xA;the county chosen by the county, hold the said assize in the county&#xD;&#xA;court, on the day and in the place of meeting of that court.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;19. And if any of the said assizes cannot be taken on the day of the&#xD;&#xA;county court, let there remain of the knights and freeholders, who were&#xD;&#xA;present at the county court on that day, as many as may be required for&#xD;&#xA;the efficient making of judgments, according as the business be more or&#xD;&#xA;less.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;20. A freeman shall not be amerced for a slight offense, except in&#xD;&#xA;accordance with the degree of the offense; and for a grave offense he&#xD;&#xA;shall be amerced in accordance with the gravity of the offense, yet&#xD;&#xA;saving always his &#34;contentment;&#34; and a merchant in the same way, saving&#xD;&#xA;his &#34;merchandise;&#34; and a villein shall be amerced in the same way,&#xD;&#xA;saving his &#34;wainage&#34;--if they have fallen into our mercy: and none of&#xD;&#xA;the aforesaid amercements shall be impsed except by the oath of honest&#xD;&#xA;men of the neighborhood.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;21. Earls and barons shall not be amerced except through their peers,&#xD;&#xA;and only in accordance with the degree of the offense.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;22. A clerk shall not be amerced in respect of his lay holding except&#xD;&#xA;after the manner of the others aforesaid; further, he shall not be&#xD;&#xA;amerced in accordance with the extent of his ecclesiastical benefice.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;23. No village or individual shall be compelled to make bridges at&#xD;&#xA;river-banks, except those who from of old were legally bound to do so.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;24. No sheriff, constable, coroners, or others of our bailiffs, shall&#xD;&#xA;hold pleas of our Crown.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;25. All counties, hundreds, wapentakes, and trithings (except our&#xD;&#xA;demesne manors) shall remain at old rents, and without any additional&#xD;&#xA;payment.***here may be an error&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;26. If any one holding of us a lay fief shall die, and our sheriff or&#xD;&#xA;bailiff shall exhibit our letters patent of summons for a debt which&#xD;&#xA;the deceased owed to us, it shall be lawful for our sheriff or bailiff&#xD;&#xA;to attach and catalogue chattels of the deceased, found upon the lay&#xD;&#xA;fief, to the value of that debt, at the sight of law-worthy men,&#xD;&#xA;provided always that nothing whatever be then be removed until the debt&#xD;&#xA;which is evident shall be fully paid to us; and the residue shall be&#xD;&#xA;left to the executors to fulfil the will of the deceased; and if there&#xD;&#xA;be nothing due from him to us, all the chattels shall go to&#xD;&#xA;the deceased, saving to his wife and children their reasonable shares.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;27. If any freeman shall die intestate, his chattels shall be&#xD;&#xA;distributed by the hands of his nearest kinsfolk and friends, under&#xD;&#xA;supervision of the church, saving to every one the debts which the&#xD;&#xA;deceased owed to him.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;28. No constable or other bailiff of ours shall take corn or other&#xD;&#xA;provisions from any one without immediately tendering money therefor,&#xD;&#xA;unless he can have postponement thereof by permission of the seller.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;29. No constable shall compel any knight to give money in lieu&#xD;&#xA;of castle-guard, when he is willing to perform it in his own person, or&#xD;&#xA;(if he cannot do it from any reasonable cause) then by another&#xD;&#xA;responsible man. Further, if we have led or sent him upon military&#xD;&#xA;service, he shall be relieved from guard in proportion to the time&#xD;&#xA;during which he has been on service because of us.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;30. No sheriff or bailiff of ours, or other person, shall take the&#xD;&#xA;horses or carts of any freeman for transport duty, against the will of&#xD;&#xA;the said freeman.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;31. Neither we nor our bailiffs shall take, for our castles or for any&#xD;&#xA;other work of ours, wood which is not ours, against the will of the&#xD;&#xA;owner of that wood.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;32. We will not retain beyond one year and one day, the lands of those&#xD;&#xA;who have been convicted of felony, and the lands shall thereafter be&#xD;&#xA;handed over to the lords of the fiefs.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;33. All kiddles for the future shall be removed altogether from Thames&#xD;&#xA;and Medway, and throughout all England, except upon the seashore.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;34. The writ which is called praecipe shall not for the future&#xD;&#xA;be issued to any one, regarding any tenement whereby a freeman may lose&#xD;&#xA;his court.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;35. Let there be one measure of wine throughout our whole realm; and&#xD;&#xA;one measure of ale; and one measure of corn, to wit, &#34;the London&#xD;&#xA;quarter;&#34; and one width of cloth (whether dyed, or russet, or&#xD;&#xA;&#34;halberget&#34;), to wit, two ells within the selvages; of weights also let&#xD;&#xA;it be as of measures.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;36. Nothing in future shall be given or taken for a writ of inquisition&#xD;&#xA;of life or limbs, but freely it shall be granted, and never denied.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;37. If any one holds of us by fee-farm, by socage, or by burgage,&#xD;&#xA;and holds also land of another lord by knight&#39;s service, we will&#xD;&#xA;not (by reason of that fee-farm, socage, or burgage) have the wardship&#xD;&#xA;of the heir, or of such land of his as is of the fief of that other;&#xD;&#xA;nor shall we have wardship of that fee-farm, socage, or burgage,&#xD;&#xA;unless such fee-farm owes knight&#39;s service. We will not by reason of&#xD;&#xA;any small serjeanty which any one may hold of us by the service of&#xD;&#xA;rendering to us knives, arrows, or the like, have wardship of his heir&#xD;&#xA;of the land which he holds of another lord by knight&#39;s service.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;38. No bailiff for the future shall, upon his own unsupported&#xD;&#xA;complaint, put any one to his &#34;law,&#34; without credible witnesses brought&#xD;&#xA;for this purpose.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;39. No freeman shall be taken or imprisoned or disseised or exiled or&#xD;&#xA;in anyway destroyed, nor will we go upon him nor send upon him, except&#xD;&#xA;by the lawful judgment of his peers or by the law of the land.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;40. To no one will we sell, to no one will we refuse or delay, right&#xD;&#xA;or justice.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;41. All merchants shall have safe and secure exit from England, and&#xD;&#xA;entry to England, with the right to tarry there and to move about as&#xD;&#xA;well by land as by water, for buying and selling by the ancient and&#xD;&#xA;right customs, quit from all evil tolls, except (in time of war) such&#xD;&#xA;merchants as are of the land at war with us. And if such are found in&#xD;&#xA;our land at the beginning of the war, they shall be detained, without&#xD;&#xA;injury to their bodies or goods, until information be received by us,&#xD;&#xA;or by our chief justiciar, how the merchants of our land found in the&#xD;&#xA;land at war with us are treated; and if our men are safe there, the&#xD;&#xA;others shall be safe in our land.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;42. It shall be lawful in future for any one (excepting always&#xD;&#xA;those imprisoned or outlawed in accordance with the law of the kingdom,&#xD;&#xA;and natives of any country at war with us, and merchants, who shall be&#xD;&#xA;treated as is above provided) to leave our kingdom and to return, safe&#xD;&#xA;and secure by land and water, except for a short period in time of war,&#xD;&#xA;on grounds of public policy--reserving always the allegiance due to us.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;43. If any one holding of some escheat (such as the honor of&#xD;&#xA;Wallingford, Nottingham, Boulogne, Lancaster, or of other escheats&#xD;&#xA;which are in our hands and are baronies) shall die, his heir shall give&#xD;&#xA;no other relief, and perform no other service to us than he would have&#xD;&#xA;done to the baron, if that barony had been in the baron&#39;s hand; and we&#xD;&#xA;shall hold it in the same manner in which the baron held it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;44. Men who dwell without the forest need not henceforth come before&#xD;&#xA;our justiciars of the forest upon a general summons, except those who&#xD;&#xA;are impleaded, or who have become sureties for any person or persons&#xD;&#xA;attached for forest offenses.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;45. We will appoint as justices, constables, sheriffs, or bailiffs&#xD;&#xA;only such as know the law of the realm and mean to observe it well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;46. All barons who have founded abbeys, concerning which they hold&#xD;&#xA;charters from the kings of England, or of which they have&#xD;&#xA;long-continued possession, shall have the wardship of them, when&#xD;&#xA;vacant, as they ought to have.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;47. All forests that have been made such in our time shall forthwith&#xD;&#xA;be disafforested; and a similar course shall be followed with regard&#xD;&#xA;to river-banks that have been placed &#34;in defense&#34; by us in our time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;48. All evil customs connected with forests and warrens, foresters&#xD;&#xA;and warreners, sheriffs and their officers, river-banks and their&#xD;&#xA;wardens, shall immediately be inquired into in each county by twelve&#xD;&#xA;sworn knights of the same county chosen by the honest men of the same&#xD;&#xA;county, and shall, within forty days of the said inquest, be utterly&#xD;&#xA;abolished, so as never to be restored, provided always that we&#xD;&#xA;previously have intimation thereof, or our justiciar, if we should not&#xD;&#xA;be in England.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;49. We will immediately restore all hostages and charters delivered to&#xD;&#xA;us by Englishmen, as sureties of the peace or of faithful service.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;50. We will entirely remove from their bailiwicks, the relations of&#xD;&#xA;Gerard Athee (so that in future they shall have no bailiwick in&#xD;&#xA;England); namely, Engelard of Cigogne, Peter, Guy, and Andrew of&#xD;&#xA;Chanceaux, Guy of Cigogne, Geofrrey of Martigny with his brothers,&#xD;&#xA;Philip Mark with his brothers and his nephew Geoffrey, and the whole&#xD;&#xA;brood of the same.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;51. As soon as peace is restored, we will banish from the kingdom&#xD;&#xA;all foreign-born knights, cross-bowmen, serjeants, and mercenary&#xD;&#xA;soldiers, who have come with horses and arms to the kingdom&#39;s hurt.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;52. If any one has been dispossessed or removed by us, without the&#xD;&#xA;legal judgment of his peers, from his lands, castles, franchises, or&#xD;&#xA;from his right, we will immediately restore them to him; and if a&#xD;&#xA;dispute arise over this, then let it be decided by the five-and-twenty&#xD;&#xA;barons of whom mention is made below in the clause for securing the&#xD;&#xA;peace. Moreover, for all those possessions, from which any one has,&#xD;&#xA;without the lawful judgment of his peers, be endisseised or removed, by&#xD;&#xA;our father, King Henry, or by our brother, King Richard, and which we&#xD;&#xA;retain in our hand (or which are possessed by others, to whom we are&#xD;&#xA;bound to warrant them) we shall have respite until the usual term of&#xD;&#xA;crusaders; excepting those things about which a plea has been raised,&#xD;&#xA;or an inquest made by our order, before our taking of the cross; but as&#xD;&#xA;soon as were turn from our expedition (or if perchance we desist from&#xD;&#xA;the expedition) we will immediately grant full justice therein.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;53. We shall have, moreover, the same respite and in the same manner&#xD;&#xA;in rendering justice concerning the disafforestation or retention of&#xD;&#xA;those forests which Henry our father and Richard our brother&#xD;&#xA;afforested, and concerning wardship of lands which are of the fief of&#xD;&#xA;another (namely, such wardships as we have hitherto had by reason of a&#xD;&#xA;fief which any one held of us by knight&#39;s service), and concerning&#xD;&#xA;abbeys founded on other fiefs than our own, in which the lord of the&#xD;&#xA;fief claims to have right; and when we have returned, or if we desist&#xD;&#xA;from our expedition, we will immediately grant full justice to all&#xD;&#xA;who complain of such things.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;54. No one shall be arrested or imprisoned upon the appeal of a woman,&#xD;&#xA;for the death of any other than her husband.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;55. All fines made with us unjustly and against the law of the land,&#xD;&#xA;and all amercements imposed unjustly and against the law of the land,&#xD;&#xA;shall be entirely remitted, or else it shall be done concerning them&#xD;&#xA;according to the decision of the five-and-twenty barons of whom mention&#xD;&#xA;is made below in the clause for securing the peace, or according to the&#xD;&#xA;judgment of the majority of the same, along with the aforesaid Stephen,&#xD;&#xA;archbishop of Canterbury, if he can be present, and such others as he&#xD;&#xA;may wish to bring with him for this purpose, and if he cannot be&#xD;&#xA;present the business shall nevertheless proceed without him, provided&#xD;&#xA;always that if any one or more of the aforesaid five-and-twenty&#xD;&#xA;barons are in a similar suit, they shall be removed as far as concerns&#xD;&#xA;this particular judgment, others being substituted in their places&#xD;&#xA;after having been selected by the rest of the same five-and-twenty for&#xD;&#xA;this purpose only, and after having been sworn.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;56. If we have disseised or removed Welshmen from lands or liberties,&#xD;&#xA;or other things, without the legal judgment of their peers in England&#xD;&#xA;or in Wales, they shall be immediately restored to them; and if a&#xD;&#xA;dispute arise over this, then let it be decided in the marches by the&#xD;&#xA;judgment of their peers; for tenements in England according to the law&#xD;&#xA;of England, for tenements in Wales according to the law of Wales, and&#xD;&#xA;for tenements in the marches according to the law of the marches.&#xD;&#xA;Welshmen shall do the same to us and ours.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;57. Further, for all those possessions from which any Welshman has,&#xD;&#xA;without the lawful judgment of his peers, been disseised or removed by&#xD;&#xA;King Henry our father or King Richard our brother, and which we retain&#xD;&#xA;in our hand (or which are possessed by others, to whom we are bound to&#xD;&#xA;warrant them) we shall have respite until the usual term of crusaders;&#xD;&#xA;excepting those things about which a plea has been raised or an inquest&#xD;&#xA;made by our order before we took the cross; but as soon as we return&#xD;&#xA;(or if perchance we desist from our expedition), we will immediately&#xD;&#xA;grant full justice in accordance with the laws of the Welsh and in&#xD;&#xA;relation to the foresaid regions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;58. We will immediately give up the son of Llywelyn and all the&#xD;&#xA;hostages of Wales, and the charters delivered to us as security for the&#xD;&#xA;peace.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;59. We will do toward Alexander, King of Scots, concerning the return&#xD;&#xA;of his sisters and his hostages, and concerning his franchises, and his&#xD;&#xA;right, in the same manner as we shall do toward our other barons of&#xD;&#xA;England, unless it ought to be otherwise according to the charters&#xD;&#xA;which we hold from William his father, formerly King of Scots; and this&#xD;&#xA;shall be according to the judgment of his peers in our court.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;60. Moreover, all these aforesaid customs and liberties, the&#xD;&#xA;observance of which we have granted in our kingdom as far as pertains&#xD;&#xA;to us toward our men, shall be observed by all of our kingdom, as well&#xD;&#xA;clergy as laymen, as far as pertains to them toward their men.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;61. Since, moreover, for God and the amendment of our kingdom and for&#xD;&#xA;the better allaying of the quarrel that has arisen between us and our&#xD;&#xA;barons, we have granted all these concessions, desirous that they&#xD;&#xA;should enjoy them in complete and firm endurance for ever, we give and&#xD;&#xA;grant to them the underwritten security, namely, that the barons choose&#xD;&#xA;five-and-twenty barons of the kingdom, whomsoever they will, who shall&#xD;&#xA;be bound with all their might, to observe and hold, and cause to be&#xD;&#xA;observed, the peace and liberties we have granted and confirmed to them&#xD;&#xA;by this our present Charter, so that if we, or our justiciar, or our&#xD;&#xA;bailiffs or any one of our officers, shall in anything be at fault&#xD;&#xA;toward any one, or shall have broken any one of the articles of&#xD;&#xA;the peace or of this security, and the offense be notified to four&#xD;&#xA;barons of the foresaid five-and-twenty, the said four barons shall&#xD;&#xA;repair to us (or our justiciar, if we are out of the realm) and, laying&#xD;&#xA;the transgression before us, petition to have that transgression&#xD;&#xA;redressed without delay. And if we shall not have corrected the&#xD;&#xA;transgression (or, in the event of our being out of the realm, if our&#xD;&#xA;justiciar shall not have corrected it) within forty days, reckoning&#xD;&#xA;from the time it has been intimated to us (or to our justiciar, if&#xD;&#xA;we should be out of the realm), the four barons aforesaid shall refer&#xD;&#xA;that matter to the rest of the five-and-twenty barons, and those&#xD;&#xA;five-and-twenty barons shall, together with the community of the whole&#xD;&#xA;land, distrain and distress us in all possible ways, namely, by seizing&#xD;&#xA;our castles, lands, possessions, and in any other way they can, until&#xD;&#xA;redress has been obtained as they deem fit, saving harmless our own&#xD;&#xA;person, and the persons of our queen and children; and when redress has&#xD;&#xA;been obtained, they shall resume their old relations toward us. And let&#xD;&#xA;whoever in the country desires it, swear to obey the orders of the said&#xD;&#xA;five-and-twenty barons for the execution of all the aforesaid matters,&#xD;&#xA;and along with them, to molest us to the utmost of his power; and we&#xD;&#xA;publicly and freely grant leave to every one who wishes to swear, and&#xD;&#xA;we shall never forbid any one to swear. All those, moreover, in the&#xD;&#xA;land who of themselves and of their own accord are unwilling to swear&#xD;&#xA;to the twenty-five to help them in constraining and molesting us, we&#xD;&#xA;shall by our command compel the same to swear to the effect aforesaid.&#xD;&#xA;And if any one of the five-and-twenty barons shall have died or&#xD;&#xA;departed from the land, or be incapacitated in any other manner which&#xD;&#xA;would prevent the foresaid provisions being carried out, those of&#xD;&#xA;the said twenty-five barons who are left shall choose another in his&#xD;&#xA;place according to their own judgment, and he shall be sworn in the&#xD;&#xA;same way as the others. Further, in all matters, the execution of which&#xD;&#xA;is intrusted to these twenty-five barons, if perchance these&#xD;&#xA;twenty-five are present, that which the majority of those present&#xD;&#xA;ordain or command shall be held as fixed and established, exactly as if&#xD;&#xA;the whole twenty-five had concurred in this; and the said twenty-five&#xD;&#xA;shall swear that they will faithfully observe all that is aforesaid,&#xD;&#xA;and cause it to be observed with all their might. And we shall procure&#xD;&#xA;nothing from any one, directly or indirectly, whereby any part of&#xD;&#xA;these concessions and liberties might be revoked or diminished; and if&#xD;&#xA;any such thing has been procured, let it be void and null, and we shall&#xD;&#xA;never use it personally or by another.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;62. And all the ill-will, hatreds, and bitterness that have arisen&#xD;&#xA;between us and our men, clergy and lay, from the date of the quarrel,&#xD;&#xA;we have completely remitted and pardoned every one. Moreover, all&#xD;&#xA;trespasses occasioned by the said quarrel, from Easter in the sixteenth&#xD;&#xA;year of our reign till the restoration of peace, we have fully remitted&#xD;&#xA;to all, both clergy and laymen, and completely forgiven, as far as&#xD;&#xA;pertains to us. And, on this head, we have caused to be made for them&#xD;&#xA;letters testimonial patent of the lord Stephen, archbishop of&#xD;&#xA;Canterbury, of the lord Henry, archbishop of Dublin, of the bishops&#xD;&#xA;aforesaid, and of Master Pandulf as touching this security and&#xD;&#xA;the concessions aforesaid.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;63. Wherefore it is our will, and we firmly enjoin, that the English&#xD;&#xA;Church be free, and that the men in our kingdom have and hold all the&#xD;&#xA;aforesaid liberties, rights, and concessions, well and peaceably,&#xD;&#xA;freely and quietly, fully and wholly, for themselves and their heirs,&#xD;&#xA;of us and our heirs, in all respects and in all places for ever, as is&#xD;&#xA;aforesaid. An oath, moreover, has been taken, as well on our part as on&#xD;&#xA;the part of the barons, that all these conditions aforesaid shall be&#xD;&#xA;kept in good faith and without evil intent. Given under our hand--the&#xD;&#xA;above-named and many others being witnesses--in the meadow which is&#xD;&#xA;called Runnymede, between Windsor and Staines, on the fifteenth day of&#xD;&#xA;June, in the seventeenth year of our reign.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;***&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The text of THE MAGNA CARTA&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Magna Carta (The Great Charter):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Preamble:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;John, by the grace of God, king of England, lord of Ireland, duke of&#xD;&#xA;Normandy and Aquitaine, and count of Anjou, to the archbishop,&#xD;&#xA;bishops, abbots, earls, barons, justiciaries, foresters, sheriffs,&#xD;&#xA;stewards, servants, and to all his bailiffs and liege subjects,&#xD;&#xA;greetings.  Know that, having regard to God and for the salvation of&#xD;&#xA;our soul, and those of all our ancestors and heirs, and unto the honor&#xD;&#xA;of God and the advancement of his holy Church and for the rectifying&#xD;&#xA;of our realm, we have granted as underwritten by advice of our&#xD;&#xA;venerable fathers, Stephen, archbishop of Canterbury, primate of all&#xD;&#xA;England and cardinal of the holy Roman Church, Henry, archbishop of&#xD;&#xA;Dublin, William of London, Peter of Winchester, Jocelyn of Bath and&#xD;&#xA;Glastonbury, Hugh of Lincoln, Walter of Worcester, William of&#xD;&#xA;Coventry, Benedict of Rochester, bishops; of Master Pandulf, subdeacon&#xD;&#xA;and member of the household of our lord the Pope, of brother Aymeric&#xD;&#xA;(master of the Knights of the Temple in England), and of the&#xD;&#xA;illustrious men William Marshal, earl of Pembroke, William, earl of&#xD;&#xA;Salisbury, William, earl of Warenne, William, earl of Arundel, Alan of&#xD;&#xA;Galloway (constable of Scotland), Waren Fitz Gerold, Peter Fitz&#xD;&#xA;Herbert, Hubert De Burgh (seneschal of Poitou), Hugh de Neville,&#xD;&#xA;Matthew Fitz Herbert, Thomas Basset, Alan Basset, Philip d&#39;Aubigny,&#xD;&#xA;Robert of Roppesley, John Marshal, John Fitz Hugh, and others, our&#xD;&#xA;liegemen.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. In the first place we have granted to God, and by this our present&#xD;&#xA;charter confirmed for us and our heirs forever that the English Church&#xD;&#xA;shall be free, and shall have her rights entire, and her liberties&#xD;&#xA;inviolate; and we will that it be thus observed; which is apparent&#xD;&#xA;from this that the freedom of elections, which is reckoned most&#xD;&#xA;important and very essential to the English Church, we, of our pure&#xD;&#xA;and unconstrained will, did grant, and did by our charter confirm and&#xD;&#xA;did obtain the ratification of the same from our lord, Pope Innocent&#xD;&#xA;III, before the quarrel arose between us and our barons: and this we&#xD;&#xA;will observe, and our will is that it be observed in good faith by our&#xD;&#xA;heirs forever.  We have also granted to all freemen of our kingdom,&#xD;&#xA;for us and our heirs forever, all the underwritten liberties, to be&#xD;&#xA;had and held by them and their heirs, of us and our heirs forever.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. If any of our earls or barons, or others holding of us in chief by&#xD;&#xA;military service shall have died, and at the time of his death his&#xD;&#xA;heir shall be full of age and owe &#34;relief&#34;, he shall have his&#xD;&#xA;inheritance by the old relief, to wit, the heir or heirs of an earl,&#xD;&#xA;for the whole baroncy of an earl by L100; the heir or heirs of a&#xD;&#xA;baron, L100 for a whole barony; the heir or heirs of a knight, 100s,&#xD;&#xA;at most, and whoever owes less let him give less, according to the&#xD;&#xA;ancient custom of fees.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. If, however, the heir of any one of the aforesaid has been under&#xD;&#xA;age and in wardship, let him have his inheritance without relief and&#xD;&#xA;without fine when he comes of age.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;4. The guardian of the land of an heir who is thus under age, shall&#xD;&#xA;take from the land of the heir nothing but reasonable produce,&#xD;&#xA;reasonable customs, and reasonable services, and that without&#xD;&#xA;destruction or waste of men or goods; and if we have committed the&#xD;&#xA;wardship of the lands of any such minor to the sheriff, or to any&#xD;&#xA;other who is responsible to us for its issues, and he has made&#xD;&#xA;destruction or waster of what he holds in wardship, we will take of&#xD;&#xA;him amends, and the land shall be committed to two lawful and discreet&#xD;&#xA;men of that fee, who shall be responsible for the issues to us or to&#xD;&#xA;him to whom we shall assign them; and if we have given or sold the&#xD;&#xA;wardship of any such land to anyone and he has therein made&#xD;&#xA;destruction or waste, he shall lose that wardship, and it shall be&#xD;&#xA;transferred to two lawful and discreet men of that fief, who shall be&#xD;&#xA;responsible to us in like manner as aforesaid.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;5. The guardian, moreover, so long as he has the wardship of the land,&#xD;&#xA;shall keep up the houses, parks, fishponds, stanks, mills, and other&#xD;&#xA;things pertaining to the land, out of the issues of the same land; and&#xD;&#xA;he shall restore to the heir, when he has come to full age, all his&#xD;&#xA;land, stocked with ploughs and wainage, according as the season of&#xD;&#xA;husbandry shall require, and the issues of the land can reasonable&#xD;&#xA;bear.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;6. Heirs shall be married without disparagement, yet so that before&#xD;&#xA;the marriage takes place the nearest in blood to that heir shall have&#xD;&#xA;notice.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;7. A widow, after the death of her husband, shall forthwith and&#xD;&#xA;without difficulty have her marriage portion and inheritance; nor&#xD;&#xA;shall she give anything for her dower, or for her marriage portion, or&#xD;&#xA;for the inheritance which her husband and she held on the day of the&#xD;&#xA;death of that husband; and she may remain in the house of her husband&#xD;&#xA;for forty days after his death, within which time her dower shall be&#xD;&#xA;assigned to her.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;8. No widow shall be compelled to marry, so long as she prefers to&#xD;&#xA;live without a husband; provided always that she gives security not to&#xD;&#xA;marry without our consent, if she holds of us, or without the consent&#xD;&#xA;of the lord of whom she holds, if she holds of another.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;9. Neither we nor our bailiffs will seize any land or rent for any&#xD;&#xA;debt, as long as the chattels of the debtor are sufficient to repay&#xD;&#xA;the debt; nor shall the sureties of the debtor be distrained so long&#xD;&#xA;as the principal debtor is able to satisfy the debt; and if the&#xD;&#xA;principal debtor shall fail to pay the debt, having nothing wherewith&#xD;&#xA;to pay it, then the sureties shall answer for the debt; and let them&#xD;&#xA;have the lands and rents of the debtor, if they desire them, until&#xD;&#xA;they are indemnified for the debt which they have paid for him, unless&#xD;&#xA;the principal debtor can show proof that he is discharged thereof as&#xD;&#xA;against the said sureties.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;10. If one who has borrowed from the Jews any sum, great or small, die&#xD;&#xA;before that loan be repaid, the debt shall not bear interest while the&#xD;&#xA;heir is under age, of whomsoever he may hold; and if the debt fall&#xD;&#xA;into our hands, we will not take anything except the principal sum&#xD;&#xA;contained in the bond.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;11. And if anyone die indebted to the Jews, his wife shall have her&#xD;&#xA;dower and pay nothing of that debt; and if any children of the&#xD;&#xA;deceased are left under age, necessaries shall be provided for them in&#xD;&#xA;keeping with the holding of the deceased; and out of the residue the&#xD;&#xA;debt shall be paid, reserving, however, service due to feudal lords;&#xD;&#xA;in like manner let it be done touching debts due to others than Jews.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;12. No scutage not aid shall be imposed on our kingdom, unless by&#xD;&#xA;common counsel of our kingdom, except for ransoming our person, for&#xD;&#xA;making our eldest son a knight, and for once marrying our eldest&#xD;&#xA;daughter; and for these there shall not be levied more than a&#xD;&#xA;reasonable aid.  In like manner it shall be done concerning aids from&#xD;&#xA;the city of London.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;13. And the city of London shall have all it ancient liberties and&#xD;&#xA;free customs, as well by land as by water; furthermore, we decree&#xD;&#xA;and grant that all other cities, boroughs, towns, and ports shall&#xD;&#xA;have all their liberties and free customs.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;14. And for obtaining the common counsel of the kingdom anent the&#xD;&#xA;assessing of an aid (except in the three cases aforesaid) or of a&#xD;&#xA;scutage, we will cause to be summoned the archbishops, bishops,&#xD;&#xA;abbots, earls, and greater barons, severally by our letters; and we&#xD;&#xA;will moveover cause to be summoned generally, through our sheriffs and&#xD;&#xA;bailiffs, and others who hold of us in chief, for a fixed date,&#xD;&#xA;namely, after the expiry of at least forty days, and at a fixed place;&#xD;&#xA;and in all letters of such summons we will specify the reason of the&#xD;&#xA;summons.  And when the summons has thus been made, the business shall&#xD;&#xA;proceed on the day appointed, according to the counsel of such as are&#xD;&#xA;present, although not all who were summoned have come.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;15. We will not for the future grant to anyone license to take an aid&#xD;&#xA;from his own free tenants, except to ransom his person, to make his&#xD;&#xA;eldest son a knight, and once to marry his eldest daughter; and on&#xD;&#xA;each of these occasions there shall be levied only a reasonable aid.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;16. No one shall be distrained for performance of greater service for&#xD;&#xA;a knight&#39;s fee, or for any other free tenement, than is due therefrom.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;17. Common pleas shall not follow our court, but shall be held in some&#xD;&#xA;fixed place.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;18. Inquests of novel disseisin, of mort d&#39;ancestor, and of darrein&#xD;&#xA;presentment shall not be held elsewhere than in their own county&#xD;&#xA;courts, and that in manner following; We, or, if we should be out of&#xD;&#xA;the realm, our chief justiciar, will send two justiciaries through&#xD;&#xA;every county four times a year, who shall alone with four knights of&#xD;&#xA;the county chosen by the county, hold the said assizes in the county&#xD;&#xA;court, on the day and in the place of meeting of that court.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;19. And if any of the said assizes cannot be taken on the day of the&#xD;&#xA;county court, let there remain of the knights and freeholders, who&#xD;&#xA;were present at the county court on that day, as many as may be&#xD;&#xA;required for the efficient making of judgments, according as the&#xD;&#xA;business be more or less.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;20. A freeman shall not be amerced for a slight offense, except in&#xD;&#xA;accordance with the degree of the offense; and for a grave offense he&#xD;&#xA;shall be amerced in accordance with the gravity of the offense, yet&#xD;&#xA;saving always his &#34;contentment&#34;; and a merchant in the same way,&#xD;&#xA;saving his &#34;merchandise&#34;; and a villein shall be amerced in the same&#xD;&#xA;way, saving his &#34;wainage&#34; if they have fallen into our mercy: and none&#xD;&#xA;of the aforesaid amercements shall be imposed except by the oath of&#xD;&#xA;honest men of the neighborhood.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;21. Earls and barons shall not be amerced except through their peers,&#xD;&#xA;and only in accordance with the degree of the offense.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;22. A clerk shall not be amerced in respect of his lay holding except&#xD;&#xA;after the manner of the others aforesaid; further, he shall not be&#xD;&#xA;amerced in accordance with the extent of his ecclesiastical benefice.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;23. No village or individual shall be compelled to make bridges at&#xD;&#xA;river banks, except those who from of old were legally bound to do so.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;24. No sheriff, constable, coroners, or others of our bailiffs, shall&#xD;&#xA;hold pleas of our Crown.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;25. All counties, hundred, wapentakes, and trithings (except our&#xD;&#xA;demesne manors) shall remain at the old rents, and without any&#xD;&#xA;additional payment.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;26. If anyone holding of us a lay fief shall die, and our sheriff or&#xD;&#xA;bailiff shall exhibit our letters patent of summons for a debt which&#xD;&#xA;the deceased owed us, it shall be lawful for our sheriff or bailiff to&#xD;&#xA;attach and enroll the chattels of the deceased, found upon the lay&#xD;&#xA;fief, to the value of that debt, at the sight of law worthy men,&#xD;&#xA;provided always that nothing whatever be thence removed until the debt&#xD;&#xA;which is evident shall be fully paid to us; and the residue shall be&#xD;&#xA;left to the executors to fulfill the will of the deceased; and if&#xD;&#xA;there be nothing due from him to us, all the chattels shall go to the&#xD;&#xA;deceased, saving to his wife and children their reasonable shares.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;27. If any freeman shall die intestate, his chattels shall be&#xD;&#xA;distributed by the hands of his nearest kinsfolk and friends, under&#xD;&#xA;supervision of the Church, saving to every one the debts which the&#xD;&#xA;deceased owed to him.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;28. No constable or other bailiff of ours shall take corn or other&#xD;&#xA;provisions from anyone without immediately tendering money therefor,&#xD;&#xA;unless he can have postponement thereof by permission of the seller.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;29. No constable shall compel any knight to give money in lieu of&#xD;&#xA;castle-guard, when he is willing to perform it in his own person, or&#xD;&#xA;(if he himself cannot do it from any reasonable cause) then by another&#xD;&#xA;responsible man.  Further, if we have led or sent him upon military&#xD;&#xA;service, he shall be relieved from guard in proportion to the time&#xD;&#xA;during which he has been on service because of us.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;30. No sheriff or bailiff of ours, or other person, shall take the&#xD;&#xA;horses or carts of any freeman for transport duty, against the will of&#xD;&#xA;the said freeman.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;31. Neither we nor our bailiffs shall take, for our castles or for any&#xD;&#xA;other work of ours, wood which is not ours, against the will of the&#xD;&#xA;owner of that wood.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;32. We will not retain beyond one year and one day, the lands those&#xD;&#xA;who have been convicted of felony, and the lands shall thereafter be&#xD;&#xA;handed over to the lords of the fiefs.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;33. All kydells for the future shall be removed altogether from Thames&#xD;&#xA;and Medway, and throughout all England, except upon the seashore.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;34. The writ which is called praecipe shall not for the future be&#xD;&#xA;issued to anyone, regarding any tenement whereby a freeman may lose&#xD;&#xA;his court.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;35. Let there be one measure of wine throughout our whole realm; and&#xD;&#xA;one measure of ale; and one measure of corn, to wit, &#34;the London&#xD;&#xA;quarter&#34;; and one width of cloth (whether dyed, or russet, or&#xD;&#xA;&#34;halberget&#34;), to wit, two ells within the selvedges; of weights also&#xD;&#xA;let it be as of measures.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;36. Nothing in future shall be given or taken for a writ of&#xD;&#xA;inquisition of life or limbs, but freely it shall be granted,&#xD;&#xA;and never denied.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;37. If anyone holds of us by fee-farm, either by socage or by burage,&#xD;&#xA;or of any other land by knight&#39;s service, we will not (by reason of&#xD;&#xA;that fee-farm, socage, or burgage), have the wardship of the heir, or&#xD;&#xA;of such land of his as if of the fief of that other; nor shall we have&#xD;&#xA;wardship of that fee-farm, socage, or burgage, unless such fee-farm&#xD;&#xA;owes knight&#39;s service.  We will not by reason of any small serjeancy&#xD;&#xA;which anyone may hold of us by the service of rendering to us knives,&#xD;&#xA;arrows, or the like, have wardship of his heir or of the land which he&#xD;&#xA;holds of another lord by knight&#39;s service.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;38. No bailiff for the future shall, upon his own unsupported&#xD;&#xA;complaint, put anyone to his &#34;law&#34;, without credible witnesses brought&#xD;&#xA;for this purposes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;39. No freemen shall be taken or imprisoned or disseised or exiled or&#xD;&#xA;in any way destroyed, nor will we go upon him nor send upon him,&#xD;&#xA;except by the lawful judgment of his peers or by the law of the land.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;40. To no one will we sell, to no one will we refuse or delay, right&#xD;&#xA;or justice.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;41. All merchants shall have safe and secure exit from England, and&#xD;&#xA;entry to England, with the right to tarry there and to move about as&#xD;&#xA;well by land as by water, for buying and selling by the ancient and&#xD;&#xA;right customs, quit from all evil tolls, except (in time of war) such&#xD;&#xA;merchants as are of the land at war with us. And if such are found in&#xD;&#xA;our land at the beginning of the war, they shall be detained, without&#xD;&#xA;injury to their bodies or goods, until information be received by us,&#xD;&#xA;or by our chief justiciar, how the merchants of our land found in the&#xD;&#xA;land at war with us are treated; and if our men are safe there, the&#xD;&#xA;others shall be safe in our land.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;42. It shall be lawful in future for anyone (excepting always those&#xD;&#xA;imprisoned or outlawed in accordance with the law of the kingdom, and&#xD;&#xA;natives of any country at war with us, and merchants, who shall be&#xD;&#xA;treated as if above provided) to leave our kingdom and to return, safe&#xD;&#xA;and secure by land and water, except for a short period in time of&#xD;&#xA;war, on grounds of public policy- reserving always the allegiance due&#xD;&#xA;to us.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;43. If anyone holding of some escheat (such as the honor of&#xD;&#xA;Wallingford, Nottingham, Boulogne, Lancaster, or of other escheats&#xD;&#xA;which are in our hands and are baronies) shall die, his heir shall&#xD;&#xA;give no other relief, and perform no other service to us than he would&#xD;&#xA;have done to the baron if that barony had been in the baron&#39;s hand;&#xD;&#xA;and we shall hold it in the same manner in which the baron held it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;44. Men who dwell without the forest need not henceforth come before&#xD;&#xA;our justiciaries of the forest upon a general summons, unless they are&#xD;&#xA;in plea, or sureties of one or more, who are attached for the forest.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;45. We will appoint as justices, constables, sheriffs, or bailiffs&#xD;&#xA;only such as know the law of the realm and mean to observe it well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;46. All barons who have founded abbeys, concerning which they hold&#xD;&#xA;charters from the kings of England, or of which they have long&#xD;&#xA;continued possession, shall have the wardship of them, when vacant, as&#xD;&#xA;they ought to have.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;47. All forests that have been made such in our time shall forthwith&#xD;&#xA;be disafforsted; and a similar course shall be followed with regard&#xD;&#xA;to river banks that have been placed &#34;in defense&#34; by us in our time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;48.  All evil customs connected with forests and warrens, foresters&#xD;&#xA;and warreners, sheriffs and their officers, river banks and their&#xD;&#xA;wardens, shall immediately by inquired into in each county by twelve&#xD;&#xA;sworn knights of the same county chosen by the honest men of the same&#xD;&#xA;county, and shall, within forty days of the said inquest, be utterly&#xD;&#xA;abolished, so as never to be restored, provided always that we&#xD;&#xA;previously have intimation thereof, or our justiciar, if we should not&#xD;&#xA;be in England.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;49. We will immediately restore all hostages and charters delivered to&#xD;&#xA;us by Englishmen, as sureties of the peace of faithful service.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;50. We will entirely remove from their bailiwicks, the relations of&#xD;&#xA;Gerard of Athee (so that in future they shall have no bailiwick in&#xD;&#xA;England); namely, Engelard of Cigogne, Peter, Guy, and Andrew of&#xD;&#xA;Chanceaux, Guy of Cigogne, Geoffrey of Martigny with his brothers,&#xD;&#xA;Philip Mark with his brothers and his nephew Geoffrey, and the whole&#xD;&#xA;brood of the same.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;51. As soon as peace is restored, we will banish from the kingdom all&#xD;&#xA;foreign born knights, crossbowmen, serjeants, and mercenary soldiers&#xD;&#xA;who have come with horses and arms to the kingdom&#39;s hurt.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;52. If anyone has been dispossessed or removed by us, without the&#xD;&#xA;legal judgment of his peers, from his lands, castles, franchises, or&#xD;&#xA;from his right, we will immediately restore them to him; and if a&#xD;&#xA;dispute arise over this, then let it be decided by the five and twenty&#xD;&#xA;barons of whom mention is made below in the clause for securing the&#xD;&#xA;peace.  Moreover, for all those possessions, from which anyone has,&#xD;&#xA;without the lawful judgment of his peers, been disseised or removed,&#xD;&#xA;by our father, King Henry, or by our brother, King Richard, and which&#xD;&#xA;we retain in our hand (or which as possessed by others, to whom we are&#xD;&#xA;bound to warrant them) we shall have respite until the usual term of&#xD;&#xA;crusaders; excepting those things about which a plea has been raised,&#xD;&#xA;or an inquest made by our order, before our taking of the cross; but&#xD;&#xA;as soon as we return from the expedition, we will immediately grant&#xD;&#xA;full justice therein.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;53. We shall have, moreover, the same respite and in the same manner&#xD;&#xA;in rendering justice concerning the disafforestation or retention of&#xD;&#xA;those forests which Henry our father and Richard our brother&#xD;&#xA;afforested, and concerning the wardship of lands which are of the fief&#xD;&#xA;of another (namely, such wardships as we have hitherto had by reason&#xD;&#xA;of a fief which anyone held of us by knight&#39;s service), and concerning&#xD;&#xA;abbeys founded on other fiefs than our own, in which the lord of the&#xD;&#xA;fee claims to have right; and when we have returned, or if we desist&#xD;&#xA;from our expedition, we will immediately grant full justice to all who&#xD;&#xA;complain of such things.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;54. No one shall be arrested or imprisoned upon the appeal of a woman,&#xD;&#xA;for the death of any other than her husband.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;55. All fines made with us unjustly and against the law of the land,&#xD;&#xA;and all amercements, imposed unjustly and against the law of the land,&#xD;&#xA;shall be entirely remitted, or else it shall be done concerning them&#xD;&#xA;according to the decision of the five and twenty barons whom mention&#xD;&#xA;is made below in the clause for securing the pease, or according to&#xD;&#xA;the judgment of the majority of the same, along with the aforesaid&#xD;&#xA;Stephen, archbishop of Canterbury, if he can be present, and such&#xD;&#xA;others as he may wish to bring with him for this purpose, and if he&#xD;&#xA;cannot be present the business shall nevertheless proceed without him,&#xD;&#xA;provided always that if any one or more of the aforesaid five and&#xD;&#xA;twenty barons are in a similar suit, they shall be removed as far as&#xD;&#xA;concerns this particular judgment, others being substituted in their&#xD;&#xA;places after having been selected by the rest of the same five and&#xD;&#xA;twenty for this purpose only, and after having been sworn.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;56. If we have disseised or removed Welshmen from lands or liberties,&#xD;&#xA;or other things, without the legal judgment of their peers in England&#xD;&#xA;or in Wales, they shall be immediately restored to them; and if a&#xD;&#xA;dispute arise over this, then let it be decided in the marches by the&#xD;&#xA;judgment of their peers; for the tenements in England according to the&#xD;&#xA;law of England, for tenements in Wales according to the law of Wales,&#xD;&#xA;and for tenements in the marches according to the law of the marches.&#xD;&#xA;Welshmen shall do the same to us and ours.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;57. Further, for all those possessions from which any Welshman has,&#xD;&#xA;without the lawful judgment of his peers, been disseised or removed by&#xD;&#xA;King Henry our father, or King Richard our brother, and which we&#xD;&#xA;retain in our hand (or which are possessed by others, and which we&#xD;&#xA;ought to warrant), we will have respite until the usual term of&#xD;&#xA;crusaders; excepting those things about which a plea has been raised&#xD;&#xA;or an inquest made by our order before we took the cross; but as soon&#xD;&#xA;as we return (or if perchance we desist from our expedition), we will&#xD;&#xA;immediately grant full justice in accordance with the laws of the&#xD;&#xA;Welsh and in relation to the foresaid regions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;58. We will immediately give up the son of Llywelyn and all the&#xD;&#xA;hostages of Wales, and the charters delivered to us as security for&#xD;&#xA;the peace.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;59. We will do towards Alexander, king of Scots, concerning the return&#xD;&#xA;of his sisters and his hostages, and concerning his franchises, and&#xD;&#xA;his right, in the same manner as we shall do towards our other barons&#xD;&#xA;of England, unless it ought to be otherwise according to the charters&#xD;&#xA;which we hold from William his father, formerly king of Scots; and&#xD;&#xA;this shall be according to the judgment of his peers in our court.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;60. Moreover, all these aforesaid customs and liberties, the&#xD;&#xA;observances of which we have granted in our kingdom as far as pertains&#xD;&#xA;to us towards our men, shall be observed b all of our kingdom, as well&#xD;&#xA;clergy as laymen, as far as pertains to them towards their men.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;61. Since, moveover, for God and the amendment of our kingdom and for&#xD;&#xA;the better allaying of the quarrel that has arisen between us and our&#xD;&#xA;barons, we have granted all these concessions, desirous that they&#xD;&#xA;should enjoy them in complete and firm endurance forever, we give and&#xD;&#xA;grant to them the underwritten security, namely, that the barons&#xD;&#xA;choose five and twenty barons of the kingdom, whomsoever they will,&#xD;&#xA;who shall be bound with all their might, to observe and hold, and&#xD;&#xA;cause to be observed, the peace and liberties we have granted and&#xD;&#xA;confirmed to them by this our present Charter, so that if we, or our&#xD;&#xA;justiciar, or our bailiffs or any one of our officers, shall in&#xD;&#xA;anything be at fault towards anyone, or shall have broken any one of&#xD;&#xA;the articles of this peace or of this security, and the offense be&#xD;&#xA;notified to four barons of the foresaid five and twenty, the said four&#xD;&#xA;barons shall repair to us (or our justiciar, if we are out of the&#xD;&#xA;realm) and, laying the transgression before us, petition to have that&#xD;&#xA;transgression redressed without delay.  And if we shall not have&#xD;&#xA;corrected the transgression (or, in the event of our being out of the&#xD;&#xA;realm, if our justiciar shall not have corrected it) within forty&#xD;&#xA;days, reckoning from the time it has been intimated to us (or to our&#xD;&#xA;justiciar, if we should be out of the realm), the four barons&#xD;&#xA;aforesaid shall refer that matter to the rest of the five and twenty&#xD;&#xA;barons, and those five and twenty barons shall, together with the&#xD;&#xA;community of the whole realm, distrain and distress us in all possible&#xD;&#xA;ways, namely, by seizing our castles, lands, possessions, and in any&#xD;&#xA;other way they can, until redress has been obtained as they deem fit,&#xD;&#xA;saving harmless our own person, and the persons of our queen and&#xD;&#xA;children; and when redress has been obtained, they shall resume their&#xD;&#xA;old relations towards us.  And let whoever in the country desires it,&#xD;&#xA;swear to obey the orders of the said five and twenty barons for the&#xD;&#xA;execution of all the aforesaid matters, and along with them, to molest&#xD;&#xA;us to the utmost of his power; and we publicly and freely grant leave&#xD;&#xA;to everyone who wishes to swear, and we shall never forbid anyone to&#xD;&#xA;swear.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All those, moveover, in the land who of themselves and of their own&#xD;&#xA;accord are unwilling to swear to the twenty five to help them in&#xD;&#xA;constraining and molesting us, we shall by our command compel the same&#xD;&#xA;to swear to the effect foresaid.  And if any one of the five and&#xD;&#xA;twenty barons shall have died or departed from the land, or be&#xD;&#xA;incapacitated in any other manner which would prevent the foresaid&#xD;&#xA;provisions being carried out, those of the said twenty five barons who&#xD;&#xA;are left shall choose another in his place according to their own&#xD;&#xA;judgment, and he shall be sworn in the same way as the others.&#xD;&#xA;Further, in all matters, the execution of which is entrusted to these&#xD;&#xA;twenty five barons, if perchance these twenty five are present and&#xD;&#xA;disagree about anything, or if some of them, after being summoned, are&#xD;&#xA;unwilling or unable to be present, that which the majority of those&#xD;&#xA;present ordain or command shall be held as fixed and established,&#xD;&#xA;exactly as if the whole twenty five had concurred in this; and the&#xD;&#xA;said twenty five shall swear that they will faithfully observe all&#xD;&#xA;that is aforesaid, and cause it to be observed with all their might.&#xD;&#xA;And we shall procure nothing from anyone, directly or indirectly,&#xD;&#xA;whereby any part of these concessions and liberties might be revoked&#xD;&#xA;or diminished; and if any such things has been procured, let it be&#xD;&#xA;void and null, and we shall never use it personally or by another.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;62. And all the will, hatreds, and bitterness that have arisen between&#xD;&#xA;us and our men, clergy and lay, from the date of the quarrel, we have&#xD;&#xA;completely remitted and pardoned to everyone.  Moreover, all&#xD;&#xA;trespasses occasioned by the said quarrel, from Easter in the&#xD;&#xA;sixteenth year of our reign till the restoration of peace, we have&#xD;&#xA;fully remitted to all, both clergy and laymen, and completely&#xD;&#xA;forgiven, as far as pertains to us.  And on this head, we have caused&#xD;&#xA;to be made for them letters testimonial patent of the lord Stephen,&#xD;&#xA;archbishop of Canterbury, of the lord Henry, archbishop of Dublin, of&#xD;&#xA;the bishops aforesaid, and of Master Pandulf as touching this security&#xD;&#xA;and the concessions aforesaid.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;63. Wherefore we will and firmly order that the English Church be&#xD;&#xA;free, and that the men in our kingdom have and hold all the aforesaid&#xD;&#xA;liberties, rights, and concessions, well and peaceably, freely and&#xD;&#xA;quietly, fully and wholly, for themselves and their heirs, of us and&#xD;&#xA;our heirs, in all respects and in all places forever, as is&#xD;&#xA;aforesaid.  An oath, moreover, has been taken, as well on our part as&#xD;&#xA;on the part of the barons, that all these conditions aforesaid shall be&#xD;&#xA;kept in good faith and without evil intent.  Given under our hand -&#xD;&#xA;the above named and many others being witnesses - in the meadow which&#xD;&#xA;is called Runnymede, between Windsor and Staines, on the fifteenth day&#xD;&#xA;of June, in the seventeenth year of our reign.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;***&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Magna Carta, by Anonymous&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE MAGNA CARTA ***&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;***** This file should be named 10000.txt or 10000.zip *****&#xD;&#xA;This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:&#xD;&#xA;        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/0/0/10000/&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Produced by Michael Hart&#xD;&#xA;Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will&#xD;&#xA;be renamed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright&#xD;&#xA;law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,&#xD;&#xA;so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United&#xD;&#xA;States without permission and without paying copyright&#xD;&#xA;royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of&#xD;&#xA;electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of&#xD;&#xA;computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It&#xD;&#xA;exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations&#xD;&#xA;from people in all walks of life.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the&#xD;&#xA;assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&#39;s&#xD;&#xA;goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will&#xD;&#xA;remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project&#xD;&#xA;Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure&#xD;&#xA;and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future&#xD;&#xA;generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary&#xD;&#xA;Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see&#xD;&#xA;Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at&#xD;&#xA;www.gutenberg.org&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Section 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg&#xD;&#xA;Literary Archive Foundation&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide&#xD;&#xA;spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of&#xD;&#xA;increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be&#xD;&#xA;freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest&#xD;&#xA;array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations&#xD;&#xA;($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt&#xD;&#xA;status with the IRS.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating&#xD;&#xA;charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United&#xD;&#xA;States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a&#xD;&#xA;considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up&#xD;&#xA;with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations&#xD;&#xA;where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND&#xD;&#xA;DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular&#xD;&#xA;state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we&#xD;&#xA;have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition&#xD;&#xA;against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who&#xD;&#xA;approach us with offers to donate.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make&#xD;&#xA;any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from&#xD;&#xA;outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation&#xD;&#xA;methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other&#xD;&#xA;ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To&#xD;&#xA;donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project&#xD;&#xA;Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be&#xD;&#xA;freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and&#xD;&#xA;distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of&#xD;&#xA;volunteer support.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed&#xD;&#xA;editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in&#xD;&#xA;the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not&#xD;&#xA;necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper&#xD;&#xA;edition.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search&#xD;&#xA;facility: www.gutenberg.org&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,&#xD;&#xA;including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary&#xD;&#xA;Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to&#xD;&#xA;subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks. ...</description>
