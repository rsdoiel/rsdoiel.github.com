I am looking for interesting work bridging both my background in Computer Science and the Humanities. For the past decade I have been involved in designing, implementing, and maintaining custom content management systems as well as integrating those systems with off the shelf software like Wordpress. I've enjoyed building RESTful/JSON APIs for new and legacy systems against data stores such as MySQL, MongoDB and Redis. I enjoy diving deeply into a problem and working through solutions that have measurable results.

I am most comfortable in a Unix environment but have worked in others in the past (e.g. Windows and Prime Information). I have written and maintained software in many languages over the course of my career (e.g. NodeJS/JavaScript, Go, PHP, Python, SQL, Perl, Java, Lisp, C) . Currently I am broadening my experience in functional programming by refreshing my knowledge of Common Lisp and learning Standard ML. I have experience implementing and running services in cloud based virtual machines. I am interested in expanding that experience to include large data sets. I commonly build software to run on both Intel and ARM processors.

## Technical Skills

+ Bash
+ Common Lisp
+ Go
+ Node.js (server side JavaScript)
+ Make
+ Mongodb
+ MySQL
+ Python
+ PHP

## Experience

Software Engineer, USC, January 1992 - Current

I was hired in a staff position at USC initially working for the Student Affairs Division and later for the Center for Scholarly Technology. Currently I am Senior Software Engineer for Web Services group in the Technology Enhanced Learning Division of Information Technology Services at the University of Southern California.

Prior to 1992 I worked freelance and in student positions. As a student employee of the University I maintained and improved custom administrative systems built on Prime Information (a variant of the Pick database environment).

Earlier employment did not involve engineering though it did include working for the Social Security Administration as a service representative and claims representative. I entered Federal employment as a GS-4 and left as a GS-9 with career status.
