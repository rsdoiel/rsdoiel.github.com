I am looking for interesting work bridging both my background in Computer Science and the Humanities. I am also looking for a shorter commute.  For the past decade I have been involved in designing, implementing and maintaining custom content management systems as well as integrating those systems with off the shelf software like Wordpress. I've enjoyed working with large data sets, building RESTful/JSON APIs.  I enjoy diving deeply into a problem and working through solutions that have measurable results.  

I am most comfortable in a Unix environment but have worked in others in the past (e.g. Prime Information, Windows). I have used many languages over the course of my computer science education (e.g. Pascal, DBase/Clipper, C, Lisp, Java) and career (e.g. Perl 4.x/5.x, Python 1.x/2.x, PHP 3.x/4.x/5.x, NodeJS/JavaScript, Go 1.x, SQL). Currently I am broadening my experience in functional programming by refreshing my knowledge of Common Lisp and learning Standard ML. I have experience implementing and running services in cloud based virtual machines. I commonly build software to run on both Intel and ARM processors.

## Experience

Software Engineer, USC, January 1992 - Current

I was hired in a staff position at USC initially working for the Student Affairs Division and later for the Center for Scholarly Technology. Currently I am Senior Software Engineer for Web Services group in the Technology Enhanced Learning Division of Information Technology Services at the University of Southern California.

Prior to 1992 I work freelance and in student employment positions. As a student employee of the University I was maintaining and improving a custom administrative system built on Prime Information (a dialect of the Pick database environment).

Early employment did not involve engineering though it did include working for the Social Security Administration as a service representative and claims representative. I entered Federal employment as a GS-4 and left as a GS-9 with career status.
