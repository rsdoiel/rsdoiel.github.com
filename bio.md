## Who am I?

I am a software engineer who focuses on building web based systems for Academic institutions.  I bring to the table both B.S. in Computer Sciences as well as an M.A. in the Humanities. For the past decade I have been involved in designing, implementing and maintaining custom content management systems as well as integrating those systems with off the shelf software like Wordpress.  I have enjoyed working with large data sets, building RESTful/JSON APIs.  I enjoy diving deeply into a problem and working through solutions that have measurable results.

    
I am most comfortable in a Unix environment but have worked in others in the past (e.g. Prime Information, Windows). I have used many languages over the course of my career (e.g.  NodeJS/JavaScript, Go, PHP, Python, SQL, Perl) and as a computer science student (e.g. Java, Lisp, C) . Currently I am broadening my experience in functional programming by refreshing my knowledge of Common Lisp and learning Standard ML. I have experience implementing and running services in cloud based virtual machines and routinely build software to run on both Intel and ARM processors.
