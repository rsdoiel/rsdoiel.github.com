## Who am I?

I am a human. I write software. Once upon a time I wrote music and prose. I am interested in the intersection of technology and the humanities.

I work as a "Digital Services Programmer" (aka. software engineer, software developer, programmer) for the [California Institute of Technology Library](http://library.caltech.edu). In my career I have focused on building web based systems for academic institutions (previously USC, now California Institute of Technology).  I bring to the table both [B.S. in Computer Science](http://www.cs.usc.edu/academics/undergrad/) as well as an [M.A. in the Humanities](http://www.msmu.edu/graduate-programs/humanities/). I enjoy diving deeply into a problem and working through solutions that have measurable results.

+ [Chrome OS](http://www.google.com/chromeos), I was a lucky CR-48 tester, then a Samsung Series 5 regular and a few more Chromebooks later I wound up using a Pixel combined with a Raspberry Pi and really enjoyed it. Then I spilt coffee on it, couldn't get it repaired and I moved on to focusing on Raspberry Pi computers.
+ Node/[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/~rsdoiel) modules
+ [Other Projects](https://github.com/rsdoiel?tab=repositories) and recent experiments
