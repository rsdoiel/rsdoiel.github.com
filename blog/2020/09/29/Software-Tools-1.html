	  <h1>Software Tools, Chapter 1</h1>
   <h2>Overview</h2>
   <p>This post starts a series revisiting the programs described in the 1981 book by Brian W. Kernighan and P. J. Plauger's called <a href="https://archive.org/details/softwaretoolsinp00kern">Software Tools in Pascal</a>. The book is available from the <a href="https://openlibrary.org/">Open Library</a> and physical copies are still (2020) commonly available from used book sellers. The book was an early text on creating portable command line programs.</p>
   <p>In this series I present the K &amp; P programs re-implemented in Oberon-7 based on the modules provided by Karl Landström's <a href="http://miasap.se/obnc/">OBNC</a> compiler[^langstrom].</p>
   <p>[^langstrom]: OBNC compiler is the work of Karl Langström, it is portable across many systems where the C tool chain is available.</p>
   <h2>Getting Started.</h2>
   <p>The opening chapter in the K &amp; P book is about getting oriented to developing in Pascal and starts off with some very simple straight forward and useful examples. It introduces programs which for the most part are included in standard POSIX compatible systems (e.g. Linux, macOS, even Windows 10).</p>
   <ol>
   <li>CopyProg, this is like "cat" in a POSIX system[^POSIX]</li>
   <li>CharCount, this is like the "wc" POSIX command using the "-c" option</li>
   <li>LineCount, this is like the "wc" POSIX command using the "-l" option</li>
   <li>WordCount, this is like the "wc" POSIX command using the "-w" option</li>
   <li>Detab, converts tabs to spaces using tab stops every four characters in a line</li>
   </ol>
   <p>[^POSIX]: POSIX defines a standard of compatibility inspired by UNIX, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX</p>
   <h3><a href="https://archive.org/details/softwaretoolsinp00kern/page/7/mode/1up">1.1. File Copying</a></h3>
   <p>The program "copyprog.pas" is shown on <a href="https://archive.org/details/softwaretoolsinp00kern/page/9/mode/1up">page 9</a>. It introduces both the copy procedure described in the preceding pages as well as complete program. This "Copy" program functions like POSIX "cat" without command line parameters. It reads from standard input and writes to standard out. The body of the pascal program invokes a procedure called <a href="https://archive.org/details/softwaretoolsinp00kern/page/8/mode/1up">copy</a> this simply reads from standard in character by character and writes to standard out character by character without modification. Two supporting procedures are introduced, "getc" and "putc". These are shown in the complete program listing on page 9. They are repeatedly used through out the book. One of the really good aspects of this simple program is relying on the idea of standard input and output. This makes "copyprog.pas" a simple filter and template for writing many of the programs that follow. K &amp; P provide a good explanation for this simple approach.</p>
   <p>Our Oberon-7 version takes a similar approach. Our module looks remarkably similar to the Pascal but is shorter because reading and writing characters are provided for by Oberon's standard modules "In" and "Out". I have chosen to use a "REPEAT/UNTIL" loop over the "WHILE" used by K &amp; P as we always try to read from standard in. One thing to note in our "REPEAT/UNTIL" look is the terminating condition. The value of <code>In.Done</code> is true on successful read and false if you hit an end of file or the read failed for other reasons. That means our loop must terminate on <code>In.Done # TRUE</code> rather than <code>In.Done = TRUE</code>. This appears counter intuitive. It is important to understand that <code>In.Done</code> meanings the read was successful and does not mean "I'm done and can exit now". Likewise before writing out the character just read I check the <code>In.Done</code> value and if TRUE, I know can display the character using <code>Out.Char(c);</code>.</p>
   <pre class="oberon"><code>MODULE CopyProg;
   IMPORT In, Out;

   PROCEDURE copy;
   VAR
     c : CHAR;
   BEGIN
     REPEAT
         In.Char(c);
         IF In.Done THEN
             Out.Char(c);
         END;
     UNTIL In.Done # TRUE;
   END copy;

   BEGIN
     copy();
   END CopyProg.
   </code></pre>
   <h4>Limitations</h4>
   <p>This program only works with standard input and output. A more generalized version would work with named files.</p>
   <h3><a href="https://archive.org/details/softwaretoolsinp00kern/page/13/mode/1up">1.2 Counting Characters</a></h3>
   <p><a href="https://archive.org/details/softwaretoolsinp00kern/page/13/mode/1up">On page 13</a> K &amp; P introduce their second program, CharCount. It is based on a single procedure that reads from standard input and counts up the number of characters encountered then writes the total number found to standard out followed by a newline. In the text only the procedure is shown, it is assumed you'll write the outer wrapper of the program yourself. The Oberon-7 version is very similar to the Pascal. Like in the our first "CopyProg" we will make use of the "In" and "Out" modules. Since we will need to write an INTEGER value we'll also use "Out.Int()" procedure which is very similar to K &amp; P's "putdec()". Aside from the counting very simple like our first program.</p>
   <pre class="oberon"><code>MODULE CharCount;
   IMPORT In, Out;

   PROCEDURE CharCount;
   VAR
     nc : INTEGER;
     c : CHAR;
   BEGIN
     nc := 0;

     REPEAT
       In.Char(c);
       IF In.Done THEN
         nc := nc + 1;
       END;
     UNTIL In.Done # TRUE;
     Out.Int(nc, 1);
     Out.Ln();
   END CharCount;

   BEGIN
     CharCount();
   END CharCount.
   </code></pre>
   <h4>Limitations</h4>
   <p>The obvious limitation is the naivete's in counting characters. Even non-printed characters are counted. Like our first program this only works on standard input and output. Ideally this should be written so it works on any file including standard input and output. If the reader implements that it could become part of a package on statistical analysis of plain text files.</p>
   <h3><a href="https://archive.org/details/softwaretoolsinp00kern/page/14/mode/1up">1.3 Counting Lines</a></h3>
   <p>LineCount, from <a href="https://archive.org/details/softwaretoolsinp00kern/page/15/mode/1up">page 15</a> is very similar to CharCount except adding an conditional count in the loop for processing the file. In our Oberon-7 implementation we'll check if the <code>In.Char(c)</code> call was successful but we'll add a second condition to see if the character read was a NEWLINE. Assuming it was we increment our counter variable.</p>
   <pre class="oberon"><code>MODULE LineCount;
   IMPORT In, Out;

   PROCEDURE LineCount;
   CONST
     NEWLINE = 10;

   VAR
     nl : INTEGER;
     c : CHAR;
   BEGIN
     nl := 0;
     REPEAT
       In.Char(c);
       IF In.Done &amp; (ORD(c) = NEWLINE) THEN
         nl := nl + 1;
       END;
     UNTIL In.Done # TRUE;
     Out.Int(nl, 1);
     Out.Ln();
   END LineCount;

   BEGIN
     LineCount();
   END LineCount.
   </code></pre>
   <h4>Limitations</h4>
   <p>This program assumes that NEWLINE is ASCII value 10. Line delimiters vary between operating systems. If your OS used carriage returns without a NEWLINE then this program would not count lines correctly. The reader could extend the checking to support carriage returns, new lines, and carriage return with new lines and cover most versions of line endings.</p>
   <h3><a href="https://archive.org/details/softwaretoolsinp00kern/page/14/mode/1up">1.4 Counting Words</a></h3>
   <p><a href="https://archive.org/details/softwaretoolsinp00kern/page/17/mode/1up">Page 17</a> brings us to the WordCount program. Counting words can be very nuanced but here K &amp; P have chosen a simple definition which most of the time is "good enough" for languages like English. A word is defined simply as an run of characters separated by a space, tab, newline characters. In practice most documents will work with this minimal definition. It also makes the code straight forward. This is a good example of taking the simple road if you can. It keeps this program short and sweet.</p>
   <p>If you follow along in the K &amp; P book note their rationals for the choices they make in choosing a simple solution. While we do see an "if then else if" sequence is remains clear what the program assumption are. This means the person reading the source code can easily verify if the approach chosen was too simple to meet their needs.</p>
   <p>Our Oberon-7 implementation is again very simple like the Pascal. Like in previous programs we still have an outer check to see if the read worked (i.e. "In.Done = TRUE"), otherwise the conditional logic is the same.</p>
   <pre class="oberon"><code>MODULE WordCount;
   IMPORT In, Out;

   PROCEDURE WordCount;
   CONST
     NEWLINE = 10;
     BLANK = 32;
     TAB = 9;

   VAR
     nw : INTEGER;
     c : CHAR;
     inword : BOOLEAN;
   BEGIN
     nw := 0;
     inword := FALSE;
     REPEAT
       In.Char(c);
       IF In.Done THEN
         IF ((ORD(c) = BLANK) OR (ORD(c) = NEWLINE) OR (ORD(c) = TAB)) THEN
           inword := FALSE;
         ELSIF (inword = FALSE) THEN
           inword := TRUE;
           nw := nw + 1;
         END;
       END;
     UNTIL In.Done # TRUE;
     Out.Int(nw, 1);
     Out.Ln();
   END WordCount;

   BEGIN
     WordCount();
   END WordCount.
   </code></pre>
   <h2><a href="https://archive.org/details/softwaretoolsinp00kern/page/20/mode/1up">1.5 Removing Tabs</a></h2>
   <p>The source code for "detab" can be found in <a href="https://archive.org/details/softwaretoolsinp00kern/page/24/mode/1up">page 24</a> in the last section of chapter 1. The "detab" program that removes tabs and replaces them with spaces. Rather than a simple "tab" replaced with four spaces, this "detab" preserves the idea of tab stops. In 1981 typewrites were still widely used though word processing software would replacement. I think this shows an important aspect of writing programs. Most humans of the time who worked in offices preparing documents assumed the type writer or even the computer interface version, the teletype, was the model's assumptions. K &amp; P implementation includes separate source files for setting tab stops and checking for a tab stop. The Pascal they used don't support separate program modules in the way later Pascal versions would (e.g. UCSD Pascal and Turbo Pascal). Modularization and code reuse are import software techniques. To allow reuse the K &amp; P book included a preprocessor for their programs that support including files inline. This preprocessor written in Pascal was based on the early versions of the "C" preprocessor they had available in the early UNIX systems. Not terribly Pascal line but it worked and allowed the two files to be shared between this program and the one in the next chapter.</p>
   <p>Oberon-7 of course benefits from all the language improvements that came before. Oberon-7 supports modules and as such their is no need for a preprocessor. Rather than have three files to build our program well have two, One will be "Detab.Mod" and the other will be "Tabs.Mod". The latter one will allow for code reuse and be the place where we define our tab stop data structure as well as the procedures that operating on that data structure.</p>
   <p>Let's look at the first part, "Detab.Mod". This is the module that forms our program by calling "Detab();" procedure in the module's own "BEGIN/END" block. We import "In", "Out" as before but we also import "Tabs" which we will show next. Like our previous examples we validate we had a successful read before testing the character and making decisions about what to write to standard out.</p>
   <pre class="oberon"><code>MODULE Detab;
     IMPORT In, Out, Tabs;

   CONST
     NEWLINE = 10;
     TAB = 9;
     BLANK = 32;

   PROCEDURE Detab;
   VAR
     c : CHAR;
     col : INTEGER;
     tabstops : Tabs.TabType;
   BEGIN
       Tabs.SetTabs(tabstops); (* set initial tab stops *)
       col := 1;
       REPEAT
           In.Char(c);
           IF In.Done THEN
               IF (ORD(c) = TAB) THEN
                   REPEAT
                     Out.Char(CHR(BLANK));
                     col := col + 1;
                   UNTIL Tabs.TabPos(col, tabstops);
               ELSIF (ORD(c) = NEWLINE) THEN
                   Out.Char(c);
                   col := 1;
               ELSE
                   Out.Char(c);
                   col := col + 1;
               END;
           END;
       UNTIL In.Done # TRUE;
   END Detab;

   BEGIN
     Detab();
   END Detab.
   </code></pre>
   <p>Our second module is "Tabs.Mod" provides the supporting procedures and definition of the our "TabType" data structure. For us this is the first time we write a module which "exports" procedures and type definitions. If you are new to Oberon, expected constants, variables and procedures names have a trailing "*". Otherwise the Oberon compiler will assume a local use only. This is a very powerful information hiding capability and what allows you to evolve a modules' internal implementation independently of the programs that rely on it.</p>
   <pre class="oberon"><code>MODULE Tabs;

   CONST
       MAXLINE = 1000; (* or whatever *)

   TYPE
       TabType* = ARRAY MAXLINE OF BOOLEAN;
       
   (* TabPos -- return TRUE if col is a tab stop *)
   PROCEDURE TabPos*(col : INTEGER; VAR tabstops : TabType) : BOOLEAN;
     VAR res : BOOLEAN;
   BEGIN
     res := FALSE; (* Initialize our internal default return value *)
     IF (col &gt; MAXLINE) THEN
       res := TRUE;
     ELSE
       res := tabstops[col];
     END;
     RETURN res
   END TabPos;

   (* SetTabs -- set initial tab stops *)
   PROCEDURE SetTabs*(VAR tabstops: TabType);
   CONST
      TABSPACE = 4; (* 4 spaces per tab *) 
   VAR
       i : INTEGER;
   BEGIN
       (* NOTE: Arrays in Oberon start at zero, we want to
          stop at the last cell *)
       FOR i := 0 TO (MAXLINE - 1) DO
         tabstops[i] := (i MOD TABSPACE = 1);
       END;
   END SetTabs;

   END Tabs.
   </code></pre>
   <p>NOTE: This module is used by Detab.Mod and Entab.Mod and provides for common type definitions and code reuse. We exported TabType, TabPos and SetTabs. Everything else is private to this module.</p>
   <h2>In closing</h2>
   <p>This post briefly highlighted ports of the programs presented in Chapter 1 of "Software Tools in Pascal". I have included links below for the source files of my implementation of the K &amp; P tools. One of the nice features of Oberon is that any text after the closing "END *." statement is ignore by the compiler. In these source files I've transcribed the documentation examples in the K &amp; P text as well as the Pascal shown in the chapter. In this way you can compare implementations easily and see what has changed between the languages.</p>
