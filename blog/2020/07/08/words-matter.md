# Words Matter

By R. S. Doiel, 2020-07-08

This may seem trivial to some. This will likely be called "PC" by those
who wish to go back to Jim Crow in the Unites States.  I have observed
in my half century of existence that words matter. What we call
things matter.  This is especially true of the words we use day to day
without thinking.

When I was a student I remember a quip that "naming things is one of
the hardest problems of computer science".  We name variables,
programs and algorithms. We name architectures. Naming is a choice.
The names convey meaning and intent. They are a human communication.
They matter.

## Names can change

I remember the first time I encountered the terms "master"
and "slave" describing client server network and database
architecture. I remember cringing at the terms. I accepted 
the terminology because I was a student and naively assumed that 
those terms were chosen and did not mean what they did.
I was wrong.

**Why do we choose the vocabulary of slavery and Jim Crow to
describe our creations?**

When I did not challenge the use of those terms in computer science
I became complicit in the status quo of systemic racism. I am not happy
about that. Not then and not now.  We need inclusive language
in engineering. We need real diversity to find solutions to
today's challenges.  In software engineering we very much control what
we call things. Software is an explicit form of written human
communication. Words count.

As a direct benefactor of white male privilege even I found the
terminology of "master/slave" offensive.  I am certain those
words caused injury to those to who did not benefit from the same white
male privilege.  I should have called them out then. I am doing so now.
The terms of "master" and "slave" to describe database architectures,
network architectures or used in version control systems like Git are
like statues that perpetuate inhumanity to my fellow humans.

Let's use better words. We have a choice about what we communicate
and mean.  Any thesaurus will provide us with much better
alternatives.


## Practice Change

**To change our discipline's vocabulary we need to use better words**. With
the help of my friends and colleagues I've found the term "main" branch
in Git to be a better, more correct and appropriate word than "master".
I've started the process of switching to it for my Git based projects. 
That has lead me to see a problem on GitHub.

## Noticed a problem

On GitHub you can change the name of the default branch easily. On
projects you can change the branch to use to publish documentation.
What you can't do is change the name of the branch used to publish
personal and group websites.  **GitHub explicitly states that the
publication branch must be named "master".** I've tested this and
confirmed the documentation is accurate as of today (2020-07-08).

With recent improvements in GitHub I believe making it possible to change
the branch name for publishing personal sites is minor. Maybe that
missing feature is an oversight.  I have been paying to user of GitHub 
for a long time.  

## Taking action

Today (2020-07-08) I submitted a ticket to GitHub asking to have the 
option of using another word besides "master" for the publication branch 
in publishing my personal GitHub pages (i.e. this blog). Unfortunately
the ticket doesn't have a public URL.

I know if I am the only person to ask for this change it will not be
implemented.  It will be overlooked as is the nature of systemic
problems. Please help improve the words and names we use in software.
I believe it can make a difference in creating a more inclusive and
equitable profession.


## Where to go from here?

Just as many sites have adopted more gender neutral terms in documentation
practice we should encourage better descriptive terms for our algorithms,
and architectures. If you run into terms perpetuating exclusion please 
speak up.  Most of the web runs on web servers and databases.  Like GitHub 
those software projects frequently use the terminology of master/slave. It 
is especially prevalent in documentation about replication. Blindly using 
the terms "master" and "slave" to describe distributed architectures is 
like a statue to the old Confederacy. It can and should be change. We can 
communicate better without perpetuating the vocabulary of Jim Crow, 
segregation, slavery and oppression.
