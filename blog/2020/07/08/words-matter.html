   Words Matter
   </h1>

   This may seem trivial to some. This will likely be called “PC” by those who wish to go back to Jim Crow in the Unites States. I have observed in my half century of existence that words matter. What we call things matter. This is especially true of the words we use day to day without thinking.
   </p>
   <p>
   When I was a student I remember a quip that “naming things is one of the hardest problems of computer science”. We name variables, programs and algorithms. We name architectures. Naming is a choice. The names convey meaning and intent. They are a human communication. They matter.
   </p>
   <h2 id="names-can-change">

   <p>
   I remember the first time I encountered the terms “master” and “slave” describing client server network and database architecture. I remember cringing at the terms. I accepted the terminology because I was a student and naively assumed that those terms were chosen and did not mean what they did. I was wrong.
   </p>
   <p>
   <strong>Why do we choose the vocabulary of slavery and Jim Crow to describe our creations?</strong>
   </p>
   <p>
   When I did not challenge the use of those terms in computer science I became complicit in the status quo of systemic racism. I am not happy about that. Not then and not now. We need inclusive language in engineering. We need real diversity to find solutions to today’s challenges. In software engineering we very much control what we call things. Software is an explicit form of written human communication. Words count.
   </p>
   <p>
   As a direct benefactor of white male privilege even I found the terminology of “master/slave” offensive. I am certain those words caused injury to those to who did not benefit from the same white male privilege. I should have called them out then. I am doing so now. The terms of “master” and “slave” to describe database architectures, network architectures or used in version control systems like Git are like statues that perpetuate inhumanity to my fellow humans.
   </p>
   <p>
   Let’s use better words. We have a choice about what we communicate and mean. Any thesaurus will provide us with much better alternatives.

   <strong>To change our discipline’s vocabulary we need to use better words</strong>. With the help of my friends and colleagues I’ve found the term “main” branch in Git to be a better, more correct and appropriate word than “master”. I’ve started the process of switching to it for my Git based projects. That has lead me to see a problem on GitHub.

   On GitHub you can change the name of the default branch easily. On projects you can change the branch to use to publish documentation. What you can’t do is change the name of the branch used to publish personal and group websites. <strong>GitHub explicitly states that the publication branch must be named “master”.</strong> I’ve tested this and confirmed the documentation is accurate as of today (2020-07-08).
   </p>
   <p>
   With recent improvements in GitHub I believe making it possible to change the branch name for publishing personal sites is minor. Maybe that missing feature is an oversight. I have been paying to user of GitHub for a long time.

   <p>
   Today (2020-07-08) I submitted a ticket to GitHub asking to have the option of using another word besides “master” for the publication branch in publishing my personal GitHub pages (i.e. this blog). Unfortunately the ticket doesn’t have a public URL.
   </p>
   <p>
   I know if I am the only person to ask for this change it will not be implemented. It will be overlooked as is the nature of systemic problems. Please help improve the words and names we use in software. I believe it can make a difference in creating a more inclusive and equitable profession.

   Just as many sites have adopted more gender neutral terms in documentation practice we should encourage better descriptive terms for our algorithms, and architectures. If you run into terms perpetuating exclusion please speak up. Most of the web runs on web servers and databases. Like GitHub those software projects frequently use the terminology of master/slave. It is especially prevalent in documentation about replication. Blindly using the terms “master” and “slave” to describe distributed architectures is like a statue to the old Confederacy. It can and should be change. We can communicate better without perpetuating the vocabulary of Jim Crow, segregation, slavery and oppression.
