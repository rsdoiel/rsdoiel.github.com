	  <h1>Review: Software Tools in Pascal</h1>

<p>By R. S. Doiel, 2018-07-22</p>

<p>This book is by Brian W. Kernighan and P. J. Plauger. It is an
example of the type of books I find I have returned to the years
but is a new &ldquo;discovery&rdquo; for me in July 2018.  The book covers
software construction through a series of programs written in
pascal. It is both about how these programs work but more importantly
how to approach problems and write sound software. While Pascal
was a popular in the 1980&rsquo;s it has faded for most people in the
21st century. It was my first computer language and I still think
highly of it and that is why when I stumbled across this work I
read it. I am not sure how I missed this work back in the 90&rsquo;s.
I was certianly aware of Kernighan as the C book written with
Richie remains one of my favorite examples of really good writing
in the area of software development.  I suspect &ldquo;Software Tools
in Pascal&rdquo; will join my short list of computer books that have
proven the test of time.</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s covered</h2>

<p>The book is organized around specific programs and their implementations.
The implementations provided are simple and straight forward. Each
section is followed by a set of &ldquo;exercises&rdquo; that extend the ideas
shown in the section. In this way you could derive the modern equivalent
of these tools.</p>

<p>If you want to follow the book along in Pascal then I think Free Pascal
available in many Debian distibutions including Rasbian on the Raspberry
Pi is a good choice.  Likewise Wirth&rsquo;s Pascal is easy enought to port
to other languages and indeed this would be a useful excersize when I
re-read the book the next time.</p>

<p>The book presents a very nice set of text oriented programs to explore
programming or re-connect with your programming roots.</p>
