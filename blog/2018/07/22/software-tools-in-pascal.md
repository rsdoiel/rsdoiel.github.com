# Review: Software Tools in Pascal

By R. S. Doiel, 2018-07-22


This book is by Brian W. Kernighan and P. J. Plauger. It is an
example of the type of books I find I have returned to the years
but is a new "discovery" for me in July 2018.  The book covers
software construction through a series of programs written in
pascal. It is both about how these programs work but more importantly
how to approach problems and write sound software. While Pascal
was a popular in the 1980's it has faded for most people in the
21st century. It was my first computer language and I still think
highly of it and that is why when I stumbled across this work I 
read it. I am not sure how I missed this work back in the 90's.
I was certianly aware of Kernighan as the C book written with
Richie remains one of my favorite examples of really good writing
in the area of software development.  I suspect "Software Tools
in Pascal" will join my short list of computer books that have
proven the test of time.

## What's covered

The book is organized around specific programs and their implementations.
The implementations provided are simple and straight forward. Each
section is followed by a set of "exercises" that extend the ideas
shown in the section. In this way you could derive the modern equivalent
of these tools. 

If you want to follow the book along in Pascal then I think Free Pascal
available in many Debian distibutions including Rasbian on the Raspberry
Pi is a good choice.  Likewise Wirth's Pascal is easy enought to port
to other languages and indeed this would be a useful excersize when I
re-read the book the next time.

The book presents a very nice set of text oriented programs to explore
programming or re-connect with your programming roots.
