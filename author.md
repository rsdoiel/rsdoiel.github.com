## Who am I?

I am a human. I write software. Once upon a time I wrote music and prose. I am interested in the intersection of technology and the humanities.

I work as a "Digital Services Programmer" (aka. software engineer, software developer, programmer) for the [California Institute of Technology Library](http://library.caltech.edu). In my career I have focused on building web based systems for academic institutions (previously USC, now Caltech).  I bring to the table both [B.S. in Computer Science](http://www.cs.usc.edu/academics/undergrad/) as well as an [M.A. in the Humanities](http://www.msmu.edu/graduate-programs/humanities/). I enjoy diving deeply into a problem and working through solutions that have measurable results.
