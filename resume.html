    <h1><a href="http://rsdoiel.github.io/cv.html">Robert Doiel</a></h1>

<p>Santa Clarita, CA, United States</p>

<p>Contact: rsdoiel@gmail.com</p>

<p>My interests bridge both my background in Computer Science and the Humanities. Between 1992 and 2015 I was involved in designing, implementing, and maintaining custom content management systems as well as integrating those systems with off the shelf software like Wordpress. I have enjoyed building RESTful/JSON APIs for new and legacy systems against data stores such as MySQL, MongoDB and Redis. I enjoy diving deeply into a problem and working through solutions that have measurable results. In Spring 2015 my focus changed to software systems used by academic and research libraries.</p>

<p>I am most comfortable in a Unix environment but have worked in others in the past (e.g. CPM, DOS, Windows  1.x - 95 and Prime Information). I have written and maintained software in many languages over the course of my career (e.g. C, Go, Groovy, InfoBasic, Java, Lisp, NodeJS/JavaScript, Pascal, Perl, PHP, Python, SQL). Currently I am broadening my experience in functional programming by refreshing my knowledge of Common Lisp. I have experience implementing and running services in cloud based virtual machines. I commonly build software to run on both Intel and ARM processors.</p>
